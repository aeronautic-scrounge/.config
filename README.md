# NeoTex: A NeoVim Starter Pack for Academic Research

This setup provides a streamlined environment for academic writing, code development, and system management with powerful AI assistance.
If you already use Git to manage your `.config/` directory, these [instructions](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config/blob/master/docs/LearningGit.md) will allow you to filter off just the NeoVim configuration.
If your are new to using Git to manage dotfiles, this configuration is intended to provide a gentle introduction while equipping you with some of the most powerful tools for editing text, streamlining the research process.

Although the configuration focuses on using LaTeX and Markdown in NeoVim, it is compatible with any programming language, and highly extensible and customizable where the AI integration makes learning about and adapting the configuration to your specific needs much easier.
If you are interested in using NixOS, you can find my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.dotfiles) here.
Although this configuration includes some features for managing NixOS, doing so will not be the focus.

## Features Overview

## AI Integration

This configuration includes powerful AI tools:

### Avante AI

Access AI assistance directly within Neovim with `<leader>ha` for questions or `<leader>ht` to toggle the interface.
Supports multiple providers including Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI), and Gemini (Google) where you can easily switch providers with `<leader>hd` as well as changing models with `<leader>hm`.

I have extended Avante to permit users to create/edit/switch system prompts for different tasks with `<leader>hp`.

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim).

### Lectic

A specialized tool for academic research and knowledge management, accessible via `<leader>ml`.
Lectic is a markdown-based frontend for Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for thoughtful, long-form conversations that can be easily archived, searched, and referenced. Unlike ephemeral chat interfaces or code-focused LLM tools, Lectic emphasizes persistence and reflection, making it particularly valuable for research, learning, and knowledge management.
