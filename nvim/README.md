   - For new features: Add documentation to this README.md

4. **Organize Related Functions**: Keep related functionality together in appropriate files:
   - Core settings: `lua/neotex/core/`
   - Plugin configurations: `lua/neotex/plugins/`
   - Filetype-specific settings: `after/ftplugin/`

## Keybinding Reference

This configuration provides extensive keybinding customizations to enhance productivity and provide a cohesive editing experience. The keybindings are organized through two main systems:

### Keybinding Documentation

For complete keybinding reference, see:
- **[Complete Mappings Documentation](docs/MAPPINGS.md)** - Comprehensive reference of all keybindings organized by context and functionality
- **[Which-Key Configuration](lua/neotex/plugins/editor/README.md#which-key-whichkeylua)** - Interactive keybinding discovery system with contextual menus
- **[Core Keymaps Configuration](lua/neotex/config/README.md#keymaps-keymapslua)** - Base keybinding definitions and customizations

### Key Configuration Files

#### Core Keybindings (`lua/neotex/config/keymaps.lua`)
Defines the fundamental key mappings including:
- **Navigation**: Window movement, buffer switching, and cursor positioning
- **Editing**: Text manipulation, folding, and basic operations
- **Terminal**: Terminal mode bindings and window management
- **File operations**: Basic file handling and URL opening

#### Interactive Keybinding Discovery (`lua/neotex/plugins/editor/which-key.lua`)
Provides the which-key system for:
- **Leader-based mappings**: Organized hierarchical command structure under `<space>`
- **Contextual help**: On-screen menus showing available key combinations
- **Filetype-specific bindings**: Dynamic keybindings that appear based on current file type
- **Plugin integration**: Unified access to plugin functionality

### Quick Access

## Further Features

### Lectic Integration

Lectic provides AI-assisted writing for markdown files with these features:

1. **Quick File Creation**: `<leader>mn` creates a new Lectic file with a template
2. **Full-File Processing**: `<leader>ml` runs Lectic on the entire file
3. **Visual Selection Processing**: 
   - Select text in visual mode (`v`, `V`, or `<C-v>`)
   - Press `<Esc>` to exit visual mode
   - Press `<leader>ms` to process the previously selected text
   - You'll be prompted to add a message/question about the selection in a multi-line input box
   - Both the selected text and your message will be added to the end of the file with appropriate formatting
   - Lectic will then process the entire file

Use Lectic for AI-assisted writing, brainstorming, or refining your markdown documents.

### Folding System

This configuration includes a smart folding system with the following features:

1. **Performance-Focused**: Default folding method is `manual` for better performance
2. **Smart Toggling**: Press `<leader>mf` to toggle between:
   - Manual folding (better performance)
   - Smart folding (expr for markdown, indent for other filetypes)
3. **Persistent Settings**: Your folding preference persists between Neovim sessions
4. **Markdown-Aware**: When smart folding is enabled for markdown files, folds will be created at headers
5. **Comprehensive Mappings**:
   - `<leader>ma` - Toggle all folds open/closed
   - `<leader>mf` - Toggle fold under cursor
   - `<leader>mt` - Toggle folding method (manual/smart)
   - All standard Vim folding keys (za, zo, zc, zR, zM) also work

The system is integrated throughout the configuration to provide a consistent experience
across all file types while prioritizing performance.

### URL Handling System

This configuration includes a comprehensive URL handling system for all file types:

1. **Universal Functionality**: Works in any file type, not just markdown
2. **Multiple URL Types**: Recognizes various URL formats:
   - Standard URLs (https://, http://, file://)

4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Jupyter Notebook Integration

This configuration provides comprehensive support for working with Jupyter notebooks through three integrated plugins:

1. **Jupytext**: Converts between Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and text formats (.md, .py)
2. **NotebookNavigator**: Enables cell-based navigation and execution
3. **Iron.nvim**: Provides REPL integration for Python, Julia, R, and Lua

#### Key Features

#### Cell Markers

The system recognizes cells based on these markers:
- **Python**: Cells are delimited by `# %%` or `#%%` comments
- **Markdown**: Cells are delimited by code blocks starting/ending with ``` (triple backticks)

#### Workflow Example

1. Create a Python or Markdown file with cell markers
2. Navigate between cells with `<leader>jj` and `<leader>jk`
3. Execute cells with `<leader>je` or execute and move to next with `<leader>jn`
4. Add new cells with `<leader>jo` (below) or `<leader>jO` (above)
5. Use additional features like `<leader>js` (split cell), `<leader>jc` (comment cell), or `<leader>ja` (run all cells)

This integration provides a seamless experience for data analysis, scientific computing, and literate programming without leaving Neovim.

### NixOS Management

These tools provide actionable insights to help you maintain a fast and responsive editing environment. See the comprehensive documentation in `lua/neotex/utils/README.md` for more details on the optimization workflow.

### Testing Your Changes

After making changes:

1. Source the modified file with `<leader>rr` or (better) restart Neovim
2. Test the functionality in realistic scenarios
3. Check for any error messages in `<leader>rs`
4. Use `:checkhealth` to verify plugin health (also linked in the dashboard `<leader>rd`)

### Troubleshooting and Debugging

#### Viewing Debug Messages

By default, debug messages are hidden to keep your Neovim experience clean. If you need to see these messages for troubleshooting:

1. **View all notification levels**: 
   ```lua
   :lua vim.notify_level = vim.log.levels.DEBUG
   ```

2. **View even more verbose messages** (including trace level):
   ```lua
   :lua vim.notify_level = vim.log.levels.TRACE
   ```

3. **Check notification history**:
   Press `<leader>rm` to view the notification history, which includes all past messages.

4. **Return to normal notifications** (hide debug messages again):
   ```lua
   :lua vim.notify_level = vim.log.levels.INFO
   ```

These debug messages can be helpful when diagnosing plugin loading issues, performance problems, or other configuration concerns.
