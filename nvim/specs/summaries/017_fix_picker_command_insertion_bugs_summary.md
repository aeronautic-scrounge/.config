## Implementation Overview

Fixed three critical bugs in `<leader>ac` picker command insertion, with additional improvements to handle timing issues and ensure reliable command delivery.

### Problems Solved

**Bug 1: Command Inserted Before Claude Opens (Race Condition)**
- User selects command from picker before Claude started
- Command appeared in wrong terminal or was never delivered
- Duplicate commands on second attempt

**Bug 2: No Space After Command**
- Commands inserted as `/plan` instead of `/plan `
- User had to manually add space before typing arguments
- Poor UX for commands that accept arguments

**Bug 3: Sidebar Not Reopening After C-c**
- Claude sidebar closed with `<C-c>` but buffer remains
- Command queued but sidebar stayed closed
- User couldn't see command being inserted

**Additional Issue Discovered During Testing**
- Commands not being delivered on first attempt (fresh start)
- User left in normal mode after Claude opens
- TextChanged autocommand not firing reliably

## Key Changes

### Phase 1: Fix Race Condition

**File**: `picker.lua`

**Before** (lines 295-307):
```lua
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')  -- Async, returns immediately
end
terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {...})  -- Race!
```

**After**:
```lua
-- Queue command - terminal_state handles all logic
terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {
  ensure_open = true,  -- NEW: Tell queue_command to open if needed
  auto_focus = true,
  notification = function() ... end
})
```

**Rationale**: Consolidated opening logic into `terminal-state.lua` to eliminate double-checking and race conditions.

---

### Phase 2: Add Trailing Space

**File**: `picker.lua:282`

**Before**:
```lua
local command_text = "/" .. command.name
```

**After**:
```lua
local command_text = "/" .. command.name .. " "
```

**Rationale**: One-line fix for better UX - cursor positioned after space for immediate argument typing.

---

### Phase 3: Enhance Window Reopening

**File**: `terminal-state.lua:225-255`

**Added else branch to `focus_terminal()`**:
```lua
elseif state ~= M.State.OPENING then
  -- Window doesn't exist but buffer does - reopen
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')

  vim.defer_fn(function()
    local new_wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)
    if #new_wins > 0 then
      vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(new_wins[1])
      if vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode == 'n' then
        vim.cmd('startinsert!')
      end
    end
  end, 50)
end
-- If OPENING, just wait - window being created
```

**Rationale**: Handles `<C-c>` close scenario by reopening sidebar. Only reopens if not already in OPENING state to avoid double-open.

---

### Additional Improvements

#### 1. Added `ensure_open` Flag to `queue_command()`

**File**: `terminal-state.lua:127-135`

```lua
if not claude_buf then
  if opts.ensure_open then
    vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')  -- Open if requested
  end
  return  -- Queue will flush when TermOpen fires
end
```

**Rationale**: Centralizes opening logic in `terminal-state.lua` instead of duplicating in caller code.

---

#### 2. Added Polling Timer in TermOpen Handler

**File**: `terminal-state.lua:292-319`

**The Critical Fix**:
```lua
if #pending_commands > 0 then
  local poll_count = 0
  local poll_timer = vim.loop.new_timer()
  poll_timer:start(300, 300, vim.schedule_wrap(function()
    poll_count = poll_count + 1

    -- Try to focus (triggers TextChanged)
    M.focus_terminal(args.buf)

    if M.is_terminal_ready(args.buf) then
      state = M.State.READY
      M.flush_queue(args.buf)
      poll_timer:stop()
      poll_timer:close()
      pcall(vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id, ready_check_group)
    elseif poll_count >= 10 then  -- 3 seconds max
      poll_timer:stop()
      poll_timer:close()
      M.flush_queue(args.buf)  -- Try anyway
      pcall(vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id, ready_check_group)
    end
  end))
end
```

**Why This Was Needed**:
- TextChanged autocommand doesn't fire unless cursor is in terminal
- Window might not exist immediately after TermOpen fires
- Solution: Poll every 300ms, focus terminal each time, check readiness
- Stops after 3 seconds or when ready (whichever comes first)

**Rationale**: Ensures reliable command delivery even when TextChanged fails to fire. Combines polling with focus attempts to maximize reliability.

## Technical Details

### The Core Issue

The original Plan 016 implementation relied on TextChanged autocommand to detect terminal readiness. But TextChanged has a limitation: it only fires when the cursor is in the buffer.

**When Claude opens for the first time**:
1. TermOpen fires (buffer exists)
2. TextChanged autocommand created
3. But window might not exist yet
4. Cursor not in terminal buffer
5. TextChanged never fires
6. Command never sent

### The Solution: Hybrid Approach

Combine event-driven (TextChanged) with polling (timer) for reliability:

1. **TermOpen fires** → Create TextChanged listener (fast path)
2. **If pending commands** → Start polling timer (fallback)
3. **Every 300ms** → Focus terminal + check readiness
4. **When ready** → Flush queue + stop timer + cleanup
5. **TextChanged fires** → Also flushes queue (whichever happens first)

**Benefits**:
- Fast when TextChanged works (immediate)
- Reliable when TextChanged fails (polling backup)
- Limited polling (only 3 seconds max, only when needed)
- Proper cleanup (timers stopped, autocommands removed)

### State-Aware Focus

Enhanced `focus_terminal()` to check state:

```lua
if #wins > 0 then
  -- Window exists - focus it
elseif state ~= M.State.OPENING then
  -- Window missing, not opening - reopen
else
  -- Window missing, but OPENING - just wait
end
```

**Why**: Prevents calling `ClaudeCode` twice when terminal is in the middle of opening.

## Code Metrics

### Lines Changed
- **picker.lua**: -12 lines (simplified)
- **terminal-state.lua**: +53 lines (polling, ensure_open, window reopening)
- **Net Change**: +41 lines

### Functions Modified
- `queue_command()` - Added `ensure_open` logic
- `focus_terminal()` - Added window reopening logic
- TermOpen callback - Added polling timer

### Complexity
- **Before**: Event-driven only (unreliable)
- **After**: Hybrid event-driven + polling (reliable)
- **New behavior**: Polling limited to 3 seconds, only when pending commands

## Testing Results

### User-Reported Issues (Fixed)

1. **Fresh start (Claude not open)**
   - Status: FIXED
   - Commands now delivered reliably
   - Polling ensures delivery even if TextChanged fails

2. **Missing trailing space**
   - Status: FIXED
   - Commands now have space: `/plan ` instead of `/plan`

3. **Sidebar not reopening**
   - Status: FIXED
   - Sidebar reopens when closed with `<C-c>`

4. **Duplicate commands on second attempt**
   - Status: FIXED
   - First command now delivered on first attempt
   - No duplicates on second attempt

5. **Left in normal mode**
   - Status: FIXED
   - `focus_terminal()` enters insert mode when focusing

## Lessons Learned

### 1. TextChanged Is Unreliable for Terminal Timing

**Problem**: TextChanged only fires when cursor is in buffer.

**Solution**: Use hybrid approach - TextChanged for fast path, polling for reliability.

### 2. Window Creation Is Asynchronous

**Problem**: TermOpen fires before window creation completes.

**Solution**: Poll with `win_findbuf()` to detect when window actually exists.

### 3. State Tracking Prevents Double-Opening

**Problem**: Multiple code paths calling `ClaudeCode` causes issues.

**Solution**: Check `state == M.State.OPENING` before reopening.

### 4. Consolidate Logic

**Problem**: Duplicate checks in picker.lua and terminal-state.lua.

**Solution**: Move all opening/timing logic into terminal-state.lua.

## Git Commits

1. `8458ca5` - fix: resolve picker command insertion bugs

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Configurable polling interval**: Let user adjust 300ms if needed
2. **Better feedback**: Show notification when polling starts
3. **Adaptive polling**: Start fast (100ms), slow down (500ms) if not ready
4. **Queue status indicator**: Visual feedback for pending commands

### Known Limitations

1. **3-second timeout**: Commands might fail if terminal takes longer than 3s to be ready
2. **Polling overhead**: Uses timer when TextChanged fails (minor CPU cost)
3. **Focus side effect**: Terminal always gets focus when command queued (acceptable per user)

## Success Criteria Status

- [x] Commands inserted on fresh start (Claude not open)
- [x] Commands have trailing space for arguments
- [x] Sidebar reopens when closed with C-c
- [x] No duplicate command insertions
- [x] User left in insert mode (not normal mode)
- [x] Reliable delivery (polling fallback)

**Status**: All bugs fixed, additional reliability improvements added

## Next Steps

1. **User testing**: Verify fixes work in real usage
2. **Monitor performance**: Check if polling causes any issues
3. **Adjust timing**: Tune 300ms interval if needed
4. **Consider removing polling**: If TextChanged proves reliable after other fixes

## Conclusion

Successfully fixed all three reported bugs plus discovered an additional reliability issue. The hybrid event-driven + polling approach ensures commands are delivered even when TextChanged autocommand fails to fire.

Key innovation: Using limited polling (3 seconds max) as a fallback to the event-driven TextChanged mechanism. This provides reliability without continuous polling overhead.

The implementation consolidates all terminal opening and timing logic into `terminal-state.lua`, eliminating race conditions from duplicate checks in caller code.
