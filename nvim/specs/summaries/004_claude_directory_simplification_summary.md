## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Consolidate directories and remove dead code

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Moved all files from `util/` to `utils/` directory
- ✅ Updated all import statements from `claude/util/` to `claude/utils/`
- ✅ Removed empty `util/` directory

- ✅ Updated pickers module configuration

**Files Affected:**
- Moved 6 files: `avante-highlights.lua`, `avante-support.lua`, `avante_mcp.lua`, `mcp_server.lua`, `system-prompts.lua`, `tool_registry.lua`
- Removed: `config.lua` (contents moved to `init.lua`)
- Updated: `init.lua` with inlined configuration

### Phase 2: Module Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Merge fragmented modules and unify terminal integration

**Session Management Consolidation:**
- ✅ Created unified `core/session_manager.lua` (563 lines)

- ✅ Focused on essential session selection and management

**Modules Removed:** 6 fragmented modules
**Dependencies Updated:** All import statements redirected to new unified modules

### Phase 3: File Size Optimization and API Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Split oversized files and simplify API surface

**Command Picker Refactoring:**
- ✅ Split `commands/picker.lua` (1,073 lines → 899 total lines):
  - `commands/picker.lua` (20 lines) - Main entry point
  - `commands/picker_ui.lua` (453 lines) - Telescope UI components
  - `commands/command_executor.lua` (426 lines) - Execution logic
- ✅ Preserved all picker functionality and keybindings
- ✅ Clean interfaces between modules

**Avante Module Splitting:**
- ✅ Split `utils/avante_support.lua` (560 lines → 555 total lines):
  - `utils/avante_support.lua` (86 lines) - Main coordinator
  - `utils/avante_integration.lua` (222 lines) - Core integration
  - `utils/avante_ui.lua` (170 lines) - UI components
  - `utils/avante_commands.lua` (77 lines) - Commands and keymaps
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility through delegation

**API Simplification:**
- ✅ Simplified `init.lua` from 18+ functions to 5 main APIs:
  1. `smart_toggle()` - Session management
  2. `show_commands_picker()` - Commands interface
  3. `create_worktree_with_claude()` - Worktree integration
  4. `send_visual_to_claude()` - Visual selection
  5. `telescope_sessions()` - Session browser
- ✅ Maintained legacy functions for backward compatibility
- ✅ Clear module boundaries with minimal forwarding

## File Structure Changes

### Before Refactoring
```
├── util/ (6 files, inconsistent naming)
├── utils/ (existing files)
├── core/
│   ├── session.lua (fragmented)
│   ├── session-manager.lua (fragmented)
│   └── worktree/
│       ├── session_manager.lua (fragmented)
│       └── terminal_integration.lua (duplicated)
├── commands/
│   ├── picker.lua (1,073 lines - oversized)
│   └── terminal_integration.lua (duplicated)
└── config.lua (redundant)
```

### After Refactoring
```
├── utils/ (consolidated, organized)
├── core/
│   └── session_manager.lua (563 lines - unified)
├── commands/
│   ├── picker.lua (20 lines - entry point)
│   ├── picker_ui.lua (453 lines - UI focused)
│   └── command_executor.lua (426 lines - execution focused)
