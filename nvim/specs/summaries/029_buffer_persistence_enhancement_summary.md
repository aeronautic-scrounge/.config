## Overview

This implementation enhanced buffer persistence for .claude/ directory files by strengthening the defensive autocmd in sessions.lua. The enhancement extends the existing workaround for git-ignored buffer disappearance with additional event coverage to handle all buffer state transitions.

## Problem Statement

Files in .claude/ directories were experiencing buffer tab disappearance despite the existing defensive autocmd:
1. Buffers would load correctly and appear in bufferline
2. After switching to terminal (<C-c>) and back, buffer tabs would disappear
3. Reopening the same file from Neo-tree would restore the buffer tab
4. This behavior was identical to the previously-resolved git-ignored file issue

## Root Cause Analysis

The original defensive autocmd (implemented to fix git-ignored buffer disappearance) only listened to two events:
- `BufAdd`: Fires when a new buffer is added to the buffer list
- `SessionLoadPost`: Fires after session restoration completes

**Gap identified**: These events did not cover normal buffer switching and window management operations. When users switched from a .claude/ file buffer to the terminal and back, no autocmd fired to re-enforce the `buflisted = true` property.

## Solution Design

### Strategy
Extend the existing defensive autocmd with additional events to ensure continuous protection during all buffer state transitions.

### Event Coverage Enhancement
Added two critical events to the existing autocmd:
- `BufEnter`: Fires when a buffer becomes the current buffer (catches switching back from terminal)
- `BufWinEnter`: Fires when a buffer is displayed in a window (catches splits and window rearrangements)

### Design Principles Followed
1. **Path-agnostic protection**: Protect ALL normal file buffers, not just .claude/ files
2. **Extend, don't replace**: Keep existing events for compatibility
3. **Simple logic**: Maintain single autocmd with straightforward checks
4. **Defensive approach**: Assume external interference, proactively protect against it

### Implementation Approach
Modified the existing autocmd to include four events instead of two, maintaining identical callback logic:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufAdd", "SessionLoadPost", "BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
  callback = function(args)
    local buf = args.buf or vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
    local buftype = vim.bo[buf].buftype
    local bufname = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buf)

    -- Ensure normal file buffers stay listed
    if buftype == "" and bufname ~= "" and not bufname:match("^term://") then
      vim.bo[buf].buflisted = true
    end
  end,
  desc = "Workaround: Keep normal file buffers listed (enhanced coverage)"
})
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Strengthen Autocmd Event Coverage
**Objective**: Add BufEnter and BufWinEnter events to defensive autocmd

**Changes made**:
1. Modified sessions.lua line 72 to add two new events
2. Updated autocmd description (line 83) from "git-ignored file fix" to "enhanced coverage"
3. Enhanced TODO comment (lines 66-71) to mention .claude/ directory files

**Testing performed**:
- Syntax validation: `nvim --headless -c "luafile ~/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ui/sessions.lua" -c "qa"`
- Manual testing: Opened .claude/tts/tts-config.sh, switched to terminal, verified tab persistence

**Outcome**: Buffers for .claude/ files now persist correctly during terminal switches

### Phase 2: Verify Cross-Session Persistence
**Objective**: Ensure .claude/ buffers persist across Neovim restarts

**Testing performed**:
1. Opened multiple .claude/ directory files
2. Switched between buffers and terminal multiple times
3. Allowed session autosave to trigger
4. Closed Neovim completely
5. Reopened Neovim and loaded session
6. Verified all .claude/ buffers restored with visible tabs

**Outcome**: All .claude/ buffers correctly saved to session file and restored on load

## Key Changes Summary

### File: lua/neotex/plugins/ui/sessions.lua

**Line 66-71** (comment update):
- Added mention of .claude/ directory files to TODO comment
- Updated description to note "enhanced coverage"

**Line 72** (autocmd events):
```diff
- vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufAdd", "SessionLoadPost"}, {
+ vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufAdd", "SessionLoadPost", "BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
```

**Line 83** (autocmd description):
```diff
- desc = "Workaround: Keep normal file buffers listed (git-ignored file fix)"
+ desc = "Workaround: Keep normal file buffers listed (enhanced coverage)"
```

## Testing Results

### Manual Verification Procedures

**Test Case 1: Terminal Switch Persistence**
- Action: Open .claude/tts/tts-config.sh, switch to terminal, switch back
- Expected: Buffer tab remains visible
- Result: PASS - Tab persists correctly

**Test Case 2: Cross-Session Persistence**
- Action: Open .claude/ files, save session, quit, reopen, load session
- Expected: All .claude/ buffers restored
- Result: PASS - All buffers restored with tabs visible

**Test Case 3: Mixed Directory Behavior**
- Action: Open mix of nvim/lua/*.lua and .claude/*.sh files, test switching
- Expected: All buffers persist consistently
- Result: PASS - No difference in persistence behavior

**Test Case 4: Special Buffer Exclusion**
- Action: Open terminal, quickfix, help buffers
- Expected: Special buffers remain unlisted
- Result: PASS - Workaround correctly filters special buffers

### Regression Testing
- Git-ignored buffer fix: Still working correctly
- Bufferline visibility system: Unaffected, working as expected
- Session autosave: Functioning normally
- No autocmd conflicts detected

## Performance Analysis

**Autocmd frequency**: Fires on 4 events (BufAdd, SessionLoadPost, BufEnter, BufWinEnter)

**Performance impact**: Negligible
- Each invocation performs only 3 simple property checks
- No file I/O or complex calculations
- Execution time: Estimated < 1 microsecond per invocation
- No noticeable impact during normal editing operations

**Event load**: BufEnter and BufWinEnter fire frequently during normal use, but the callback logic is extremely lightweight and does not accumulate performance overhead.

## Documentation Updates

### Inline Code Documentation
- Updated TODO comment to mention .claude/ directory files
- Updated autocmd description to reflect enhanced event coverage
- Maintained clear explanation of workaround purpose

### Report Documentation
- Updated specs/reports/037_debug_gitignored_buffer_disappearance.md with new "Extension to .claude/ Directory Files" section
- Documented root cause analysis for .claude/ issue
- Added references to implementation plan and summary

### README Documentation
- Updated lua/neotex/plugins/ui/README.md to document defensive autocmd feature in Session Management section

## Technical Insights

### Why Event Coverage Matters
The original workaround caught buffers at creation (`BufAdd`) and session load (`SessionLoadPost`), but missed ongoing state transitions. Adding `BufEnter` and `BufWinEnter` ensures protection during:
- Switching between buffers with keyboard shortcuts
- Returning from terminal or special buffers
- Window splits and rearrangements
- Focus changes during window navigation

### Path-Agnostic vs. Path-Specific Protection
An alternative approach would have been to add explicit .claude/ path checking. This was rejected because:
1. **Simplicity**: Path-agnostic logic is easier to understand and maintain
2. **Root cause**: The underlying issue affects all paths, not just .claude/
3. **Fragility**: Path-specific checks would need updates for each new problematic directory
4. **User preference**: User explicitly requested avoiding fragile configurations

### Unknown Root Cause Acceptance
Despite extensive investigation (documented in report 037), the actual plugin or mechanism that unlists buffers remains unknown. This implementation accepts the defensive workaround as a permanent solution because:
1. It successfully prevents the symptom
2. It has negligible performance impact
3. It maintains code simplicity
4. Finding the root cause would require extensive debugging of third-party plugin internals
5. The workaround is robust and unlikely to break

## Lessons Learned

### Event-Driven Autocmd Design
When implementing defensive autocmds, comprehensive event coverage is critical. Initial implementations may work for specific scenarios but miss edge cases that only appear during normal user workflows.

### Defensive Programming Value
Rather than hunting for elusive root causes in third-party code, simple defensive programming can provide robust, maintainable solutions. The 12-line autocmd elegantly solves a complex interaction problem.

### Simplicity Over Specificity
Path-agnostic protection that covers all normal file buffers is more robust than path-specific logic targeting individual problematic directories. General solutions scale better and require less maintenance.

## Future Considerations

### If Root Cause is Identified
Should the specific plugin/mechanism that unlists buffers be discovered:
1. Evaluate whether targeted fix is simpler than current workaround
2. Consider whether removing workaround is worth the risk
3. Keep workaround if targeted fix is complex or fragile

### If Issue Resurfaces
If buffer disappearance occurs despite enhanced autocmd:
1. Add debug logging to track buffer state changes
2. Use `:autocmd BufEnter` to identify conflicting autocmds
3. Check event ordering with `:verbose autocmd`
4. Consider adding additional events (BufWinLeave, WinEnter, etc.)

### Monitoring Recommendations
Users can verify autocmd effectiveness with:
```vim
" Check autocmd registration
:autocmd BufEnter

" Check buffer listing status
:lua print("Current buffer listed: " .. tostring(vim.bo.buflisted))

" Verify all buffers are listed
:ls
```
