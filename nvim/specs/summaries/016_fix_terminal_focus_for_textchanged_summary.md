## Implementation Overview

Fixed the critical bug from Plan 015 where TextChanged autocommand doesn't fire unless cursor is in the terminal buffer. Implemented Solution 2 from Report 026: focus the Claude Code terminal to trigger TextChanged when command is queued.

### Problem Solved

**Before** (broken flow):
1. User selects command from `<leader>ac` picker
2. Claude Code opens
3. Command queued
4. TextChanged autocommand created but **never fires** (cursor not in terminal)
5. Command never sent

**After** (fixed flow):
1. User selects command from `<leader>ac` picker
2. Claude Code opens
3. Command queued
4. **Terminal focused** → cursor moves to terminal
5. TextChanged fires → readiness detected → queue flushed → command sent

## Key Changes

### Modified queue_command Function

**File**: `lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/utils/terminal-state.lua`

**New logic** (3 execution paths):

```lua
function M.queue_command(command_text, opts)
  -- Always queue first
  table.insert(pending_commands, { text, timestamp, opts })

  local claude_buf = M.find_claude_terminal()

  -- Path 1: No terminal → queue for TermOpen event
  if not claude_buf then
    return
  end

  -- Path 2: Terminal ready → send immediately
  if M.is_terminal_ready(claude_buf) then
    state = M.State.READY
    M.flush_queue(claude_buf)

  -- Path 3: Terminal exists but not ready → focus + delay + check
  else
    M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)  -- THIS IS THE KEY FIX

    vim.defer_fn(function()
      if M.is_terminal_ready(claude_buf) then
        state = M.State.READY
        M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
      else
        M.flush_queue(claude_buf)  -- Try anyway
      end
    end, 500)
  end
end
```

### Key Innovation: Terminal Focus

**Why focusing works**:
- Moves cursor into terminal buffer
- TextChanged autocommand can now fire
- User sees command being inserted (good feedback)
- No complex timer coordination needed

**User acceptance**: Per user - "It is OK to focus claude code terminal when making a selection from <leader>ac picker"

## Technical Details

### Three Execution Paths

1. **No terminal exists**
   - Just queue command
   - TermOpen will handle when terminal opens

2. **Terminal ready**
   - Send immediately via flush_queue()
   - No focus needed (already ready)

3. **Terminal exists but not ready** (the fix!)
   - Focus terminal → triggers TextChanged
   - Wait 500ms for render
   - Check readiness again
   - Send command (or try anyway if still not ready)

### 500ms Delay Rationale

From Report 026 timing analysis:
- Terminal buffer creation: ~50-100ms
- Content rendering: ~200-500ms
- Full UI ready: ~500-1000ms

**500ms chosen as safe middle ground**:
- Covers most cases (render in 200-500ms)
- Not too long to feel sluggish
- Fallback: send anyway if not ready

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Terminal already ready**: No focus needed, immediate send
2. **Terminal opening**: TermOpen + focus triggers TextChanged
3. **Terminal not ready**: Focus + 500ms + check/send
4. **No terminal**: Queue only, TermOpen handles later

## Report Integration

### Solution 2 from Report 026

Report 026 presented 4 solutions. We implemented **Solution 2: Focus Terminal Then Send**.

**Why Solution 2**:
- User explicitly approved terminal focus for picker use case
- Simple implementation (no timer coordination)
- Reliable (focusing guarantees TextChanged fires)
- Good UX (user sees command insertion)

**Why not other solutions**:
- Solution 1 (Hybrid Timer): More complex, user approved simpler approach
- Solution 3 (TermEnter): Requires manual user action
- Solution 4 (Immediate Send): Fixed delay, not responsive to state

### Report 026 Insights Applied

1. **TextChanged bug documented**: Report identified cursor requirement
2. **Three paths needed**: Report showed different scenarios require different handling
3. **500ms timing**: Report's timing analysis informed delay choice
4. **Focus as solution**: Report's Solution 2 provided the implementation pattern

## Code Metrics

### Lines Changed
- **Modified**: 1 function in terminal-state.lua
- **Added**: 21 lines (expanded queue_command logic)
- **Removed**: 5 lines (simplified old logic)
- **Net Change**: +16 lines

### Complexity
- **Before**: Simple 2-path logic (ready vs not ready)
- **After**: Smart 3-path logic (no terminal, ready, not ready with focus)
- **New behavior**: Terminal focus when needed

## Testing Status

### Automated Testing
✅ **Module loads**: Confirmed terminal-state.lua loads without errors
✅ **Function exists**: Confirmed queue_command is accessible
✅ **No syntax errors**: Module compiles successfully

### User Testing Required
The following scenarios require interactive testing with actual nvim session:

1. **Picker when Claude not started**
   - Test: `<leader>ac`, select command
   - Expected: Claude opens, gets focus, command appears

2. **Picker when Claude already open**
   - Test: Open Claude, switch back, `<leader>ac`, select command
   - Expected: Claude gets focus, command appears

3. **Visual selection when Claude not started**
   - Test: Select text, `<leader>as`
   - Expected: Claude opens, gets focus, selection sent

4. **Visual selection when Claude already open**
   - Test: Open Claude, switch back, select text, `<leader>as`
   - Expected: Claude gets focus, selection sent

5. **Rapid commands**
   - Test: Multiple quick `<leader>ac` selections
   - Expected: All commands queued and sent in order

## User Experience

### Terminal Focus Behavior

**Intentional focus change**:
- User explicitly chose command from picker → expect to see it execute
- Visual feedback: User sees command being inserted
- Makes sense for workflow: command picker → Claude Code

**Benefits**:
- Clear user feedback
- Reliable command delivery
- Simple mental model

**Acceptable tradeoff**:
- Focus change might interrupt flow slightly
- But user gets clear confirmation command was sent
- Better than silent failure (old behavior)

## Known Limitations

### TextChanged Dependency

Still relies on TextChanged autocommand, which has limitations:
- Only fires when cursor in buffer (solved by focus)
- Might not fire if terminal updates slowly
- Fallback: send anyway after 500ms

### Focus Side Effect

Focusing terminal means:
- User loses position in source file temporarily
- Must navigate back if they want to continue editing
- This is acceptable per user preference

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Simple Solutions Can Work

We chose Solution 2 over more complex alternatives:
- No timer coordination needed
- No complex state machine
- Just focus + small delay

### 2. User Requirements Matter

User explicitly said terminal focus is OK:
- Drove solution selection
- Simplified implementation
- Improved UX (clear feedback)

### 3. Report Analysis Saves Time

Report 026 analyzed 4 solutions:
- We picked best one for use case
- Avoided implementation dead ends
- Had timing data ready

### 4. Testing Limitations

Automated testing limited for interactive features:
- Module loading: Can test
- Integration: Requires user
- UX: Requires user feedback

## Git Commits

1. `622e896` - Phase 1: Modify queue_command Function

## Future Enhancements

### If Solution 2 Proves Insufficient

Fallback options (in order):
1. Try reducing delay from 500ms to 300ms (if too slow)
2. Add immediate readiness check before focus (skip focus if already ready)
3. Implement Solution 1 (Hybrid Timer) if focus doesn't work

### Potential Improvements

1. **Configurable delay**: Let user adjust 500ms if needed
2. **Skip focus if ready**: Check readiness before focusing
3. **Better feedback**: Show notification when focusing terminal
4. **Queue status**: Visual indicator of pending commands

## Success Criteria Status

- [x] Code implementation complete (queue_command modified with focus logic)
- [ ] Commands from `<leader>ac` picker appear in Claude terminal (requires user testing)
- [ ] Works when Claude not yet started (requires user testing)
- [ ] Works when Claude already open (requires user testing)
- [ ] TextChanged autocommand fires reliably (requires user testing)
- [ ] No race conditions (requires user testing)
- [ ] Acceptable user experience (terminal focus is intentional) (requires user testing)

**Status**: Implementation complete, ready for user testing

## Next Steps

1. **User testing**: Test all scenarios interactively
2. **Feedback collection**: Note any issues or unexpected behavior
3. **Adjustment**: Tune delay or approach if needed
4. **Documentation update**: Update success criteria based on results

## Conclusion

Implementation successfully addresses the TextChanged firing bug by focusing the terminal when needed. The solution is simple, follows user requirements (terminal focus acceptable), and requires minimal code changes. User testing will confirm if the approach works reliably in practice.

The focus-based approach provides clear user feedback (seeing command inserted) and aligns well with the picker workflow (explicit command selection → see it execute). If testing reveals issues, we have fallback options documented in Report 026.
