| `/update` | dependent | plan, report, implement | ✓ Accurate |
| `/test-all` | dependent | test, implement | ✓ Accurate |

### Verification Methodology

For each command, the audit:
1. **Extracted metadata**: Read `dependent-commands:` frontmatter field
2. **Scanned content**: Searched for `/command-name` invocations using grep
3. **Compared declared vs actual**: Verified all invoked commands are declared
4. **Validated relationships**: Confirmed dependencies are bidirectional where applicable

## Keyboard Shortcuts Analysis

### Current Mappings (picker.lua)

Analyzed keyboard shortcuts in `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/commands/picker.lua`:

| Key Binding | Function | Help Text | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Enter (CR) | Insert command into terminal | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-n | Create new command | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-l | Load artifact locally | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-u | Update artifact from global | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-s | Save local artifact to global | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-e | Edit artifact file | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Ctrl-j/k | Move selection down/up | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |
| Escape | Close picker | ✓ Matches | ✓ Accurate |

### Help Text Location

Help text is displayed in picker preview at lines 848-894:
- File: `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/commands/picker.lua`
- Lines: 848-894

### Verification Results

**All keyboard shortcuts are accurately documented.** The help text correctly describes:
- Action triggers (Enter, Ctrl-* combinations)
- Navigation controls (Ctrl-j/k, Escape)
- Artifact type indicators (* for local)
- File operation capabilities
- Batch operations ([Load All])

**No discrepancies found.**

### Enhancement Opportunities

While not discrepancies, these enhancements could improve clarity:

1. **Ctrl-e scope clarification**: Help text states "Commands and Hooks only" - could be more prominent
2. **[Load All] entry**: Well-documented in help text, clearly indicates batch synchronization
3. **Artifact types**: Excellent documentation of Commands, Agents, Hooks, TTS Files, Templates, Lib, Docs

## Agent Relationships

  description: "Brief task description using {agent} protocol"
  prompt: "Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
          /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md

          You are acting as a {Agent Name} with the tools and constraints
          defined in that file.

          {thinking-mode-directive}

          {Task-specific context and requirements}
  "
}
```

### Agent Performance Tracking

Agent performance is tracked via the `post-subagent-metrics.sh` hook:
- Registry: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/agent-registry.json`
- Metrics: Total invocations, success rate, average duration
- Updated on SubagentStop event

## Hook Relationships

### Hook System Overview

The hook system consists of 3 hooks in `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/hooks/`:

1. **post-command-metrics.sh**
2. **post-subagent-metrics.sh**
3. **tts-dispatcher.sh**

### Hook Event Mappings

| Hook File | Events | Purpose | Trigger Frequency |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| post-command-metrics.sh | Stop | Command execution metrics | Every command completion |
| post-subagent-metrics.sh | SubagentStop | Agent performance tracking | Every agent completion |
| tts-dispatcher.sh | Stop, Notification | Text-to-speech notifications | Completion and permissions |

### Hook Details

#### 1. post-command-metrics.sh
- **Event**: Stop
- **Purpose**: Collect command execution metrics for performance analysis
- **Data Collected**:
  - Timestamp (ISO 8601)
  - Command name (operation)
  - Duration (milliseconds)
  - Status (success/failure)
- **Storage**: `.claude/data/metrics/YYYY-MM.jsonl`
- **Rotation**: Monthly
- **Used by**: `/analyze` command for performance analysis

#### 2. post-subagent-metrics.sh
- **Event**: SubagentStop
- **Purpose**: Track agent performance and efficiency
- **Data Collected**:
  - Agent type
  - Total invocations
  - Success count
  - Total/average duration
  - Success rate
  - Last execution timestamp
- **Storage**: `.claude/agents/agent-registry.json`
- **Used by**: `/analyze agents` for performance insights

#### 3. tts-dispatcher.sh
- **Events**: Stop, Notification
- **Purpose**: Central dispatcher for text-to-speech notifications
- **Categories**:
  - Completion notifications (Stop event)
  - Permission requests (Notification event)
- **Configuration**: `.claude/tts/tts-config.sh`
- **Message Library**: `.claude/tts/tts-messages.sh`
- **Voice Engine**: espeak-ng with configurable pitch/speed
- **Behavior**: Always asynchronous, non-blocking, fails silently

### Hook Configuration

All hooks:
- Exit with status 0 (non-blocking)
- Fail silently if dependencies missing
- Run in background/asynchronously
- Parse JSON input from stdin
- Support both jq and fallback parsing

### Hook Integration Points

Commands interact with hooks indirectly through Claude Code events:
- **No direct invocation**: Commands don't call hooks directly
- **Event-driven**: Hooks respond to lifecycle events
- **Metrics collection**: Transparent performance tracking
- **User experience**: TTS enhances feedback without blocking

## Recommendations

### 1. Command Dependency Enhancements

**Minor Enhancement**: Consider adding `/expand` to `/plan` dependent-commands
- **Rationale**: `/plan` recommends using `/expand phase` for complex phases
- **Impact**: Low - documentation consistency improvement
- **Implementation**: Update `/plan` command metadata

### 2. Documentation Improvements

**No changes needed** - All documentation is accurate and comprehensive:
- Keyboard shortcuts perfectly match implementation
- Agent relationships are well-documented
- Hook system is clearly described
- Dependency declarations are accurate

### 3. System Health

**Excellent overall system health**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-defined dependencies
- Comprehensive agent system
- Non-blocking hook architecture
- Accurate metadata across all artifacts

## Conclusion

This audit found **no critical discrepancies** in the command dependency system, keyboard shortcuts, agent relationships, or hook relationships. The system demonstrates:

- **Accurate metadata**: All `dependent-commands` declarations match actual usage
- **Consistent UX**: Keyboard shortcuts match help text precisely
- **Clear architecture**: Agent relationships are well-defined and documented
- **Robust hooks**: Event-driven system with proper error handling
- **Good practices**: Non-blocking operations, fail-silent hooks, comprehensive tracking

**Overall Status**: ✓ System is production-ready with excellent metadata accuracy
