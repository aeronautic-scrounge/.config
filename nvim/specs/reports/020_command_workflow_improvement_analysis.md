2. Standardize parameter syntax across all commands
3. Add workflow guidance for new users
4. Clarify overlapping commands
5. Create orchestration facade commands
6. Add branch/PR management commands

## Background

Custom slash commands in Claude Code enable developers to encapsulate complex workflows into reusable, shareable prompts. They serve as the primary interface for automating development tasks and coordinating multi-step operations.

### Claude Code Command Architecture

Commands are markdown files stored in:
- **Project-level**: `.claude/commands/` (version controlled, shared with team)
- **Personal-level**: `~/.claude/commands/` (global, user-specific)

Commands support:
- Frontmatter configuration (tools, arguments, model selection)
- Dynamic arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- File references (`@filename`)
- Bash execution (`!command`)
- Namespacing (subdirectories)

## Current State Analysis

### Command Inventory

The system contains **27 commands** organized into 6 functional categories:

#### A. Planning & Research (4 commands)
- `/report` - Research and documentation creation
- `/plan` - Implementation plan generation
- `/update-report` - Research update workflow
- `/update-plan` - Plan modification workflow

#### B. Implementation & Execution (4 commands)
- `/implement` - Execute implementation plans with auto-testing/commits
- `/resume-implement` - Continue interrupted implementations
- `/revise` - Modify plans without execution
- `/orchestrate` - Full multi-agent workflow (research → plan → implement)

#### C. Quality Assurance (4 commands)
- `/test` - Targeted test execution
- `/test-all` - Complete test suite
- `/debug` - Diagnostic investigation with report generation
- `/refactor` - Code quality analysis

#### D. Documentation & Setup (4 commands)
- `/document` - Automated documentation updates
- `/setup` - CLAUDE.md configuration
- `/cleanup` - CLAUDE.md optimization
- `/validate-setup` - Configuration verification

#### E. Discovery & Navigation (3 commands)
- `/list-plans` - Find implementation plans
- `/list-reports` - Find research reports
- `/list-summaries` - Find implementation summaries

#### F. Orchestration Infrastructure (8 commands)
- `/coordination-hub` - Workflow lifecycle management
- `/resource-manager` - Resource allocation and conflict prevention
- `/workflow-status` - Real-time monitoring
- `/workflow-recovery` - Checkpoint-based failure recovery
- `/workflow-template` - Template generation
- `/dependency-resolver` - Dependency analysis and ordering
- `/performance-monitor` - Performance analytics
- `/progress-aggregator` - Multi-workflow progress tracking

### Workflow Patterns

**Standard Development Flow**:
```
/report → /plan → /implement → /test-all → /document
```

**Orchestrated Flow**:
```
/orchestrate (automates: report → plan → implement → test)
```

**Debugging Flow**:
```
/debug → /plan → /implement → /test
```

**Resume Flow**:
```
/list-plans → /resume-implement → /test → /document
```

### Integration Strengths

1. **CLAUDE.md Integration**: All commands reference project standards
2. **Specs Protocol**: Consistent numbering (001, 002, 003...) for plans/reports/summaries
3. **Git Integration**: Auto-commits after implementation phases
4. **Testing Integration**: Auto-detection and execution from CLAUDE.md protocols
5. **Auto-Detection**: Commands intelligently find incomplete work

### Frontmatter Usage

All commands include comprehensive metadata:
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task]
argument-hint: <feature-description> [report-path1] [report-path2]...
description: Create detailed implementation plan
command-type: primary
dependent-commands: [implement, update-plan, revise]
---
```

Command types:
- **primary**: Core workflow commands (entry points)
- **secondary**: Workflow extension commands
- **utility**: Supporting/infrastructure commands
- **dependent**: Requires other commands to be useful

## Key Findings from Best Practices Research

### Official Claude Code Recommendations

1. **Command Organization**
   - Use namespacing for logical grouping (e.g., `/dev:`, `/test:`, `/project:`)
   - Separate project-specific from personal commands
   - Group by phase or domain

2. **Argument Design**
   - Use `$ARGUMENTS` for all arguments
   - Use `$1`, `$2` for positional parameters
   - Provide clear `argument-hint` in frontmatter

3. **Tool Restrictions**
   - Specify `allowed-tools` for security
   - Minimize tool access to what's necessary
   - Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for non-AI commands

4. **Token Optimization**
   - Extract fixed workflows from CLAUDE.md to slash commands
   - Can reduce token usage by ~20%
   - Keep command prompts concise but complete

5. **Workflow Design**
   - Create focused, incremental missions
   - Design commands that compose/chain together
   - Break complex tasks into manageable steps
   - Use iterative approaches (2-3 iterations for best results)

### Community Best Practices

From analysis of professional command suites and community patterns:

1. **Namespace Conventions**
   ```
   /dev:code-review
   /test:unit
   /project:setup
   /security:audit
   ```

2. **Descriptive Naming**
   - Action-oriented verbs
   - Clear purpose indication
   - Lowercase with hyphens

3. **Modular Design**
   - Single responsibility per command
   - Easy to extend
   - Composable workflows

4. **Context Awareness**
   - Commands adapt to project structure
   - Leverage project-specific configuration
   - Provide intelligent defaults

5. **Help Integration**
   - Include usage examples in command descriptions
   - Document parameters clearly
   - Provide workflow guidance

### Areas for Improvement (Gaps)

#### 1. Namespace Organization ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**: Flat structure with 27 commands at root level
**Best Practice**: Hierarchical namespacing (e.g., `/dev:`, `/workflow:`, `/test:`)

**Impact**:
- Difficult to discover related commands
- No visual grouping in command menu
- Namespace collisions possible

**Recommendation**:
```
/workflow:implement
/workflow:resume
/workflow:orchestrate

/quality:test
/quality:test-all
/quality:debug
/quality:refactor

/docs:report
/docs:plan
/docs:document
/docs:update-report
/docs:update-plan

/discover:list-plans
/discover:list-reports
/discover:list-summaries

/setup:init
/setup:cleanup
/setup:validate

/orchestration:hub
/orchestration:status
/orchestration:recovery
/orchestration:resources
/orchestration:monitor
/orchestration:resolver
/orchestration:templates
/orchestration:aggregator
```

#### 2. No Help System ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**: No `/help` command or `--help` flag support
**Best Practice**: Built-in help and examples

**Impact**:
- Users must read .md files to learn usage
- Poor discoverability
- Steep learning curve

**Recommendation**:
Create `/help` command that:
- Lists all available commands with descriptions
- Shows command categories
- Provides usage examples
- Displays workflow patterns

Add `--help` flag support to all commands via frontmatter.

#### 3. Parameter Syntax Inconsistency ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**: Mixed parameter styles
- Brackets: `[plan-file] [phase]`
- Flags: `--dry-run --template=name`
- JSON: `'{...}'`

**Best Practice**: Consistent argument syntax across all commands

**Impact**:
- Confusing user experience
- Harder to learn command system
- Documentation complexity

**Recommendation**:
Standardize on flags for options, positional for required:
```
/implement <plan-file> [--phase=N] [--no-test]
/orchestrate <description> [--dry-run] [--template=NAME] [--priority=high]
```

Update `argument-hint` frontmatter to reflect standard syntax.

#### 4. Command Overlap and Confusion ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**: Similar functionality in multiple commands
- `/implement` vs `/resume-implement` (both auto-detect and resume)
- `/setup` vs `/cleanup` (both modify CLAUDE.md)

**Best Practice**: Clear separation of concerns, minimal overlap

**Impact**:
- Users unsure which command to use
- Maintenance burden
- Inconsistent behavior

**Recommendation**:

**Option A - Merge**:
- Merge `/implement` and `/resume-implement` into single command with auto-detect
- Merge `/cleanup` into `/setup` as `--cleanup` flag

**Option B - Clarify**:
- `/implement` - Only for new implementations (fail if incomplete exists)
- `/resume-implement` - Only for resuming (fail if nothing to resume)
- `/setup` - Initial creation only
- `/cleanup` - Optimization only (requires existing CLAUDE.md)

Document clear usage guidelines for each command.

#### 5. Missing Workflow Guidance ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**: No guided workflows or command relationship visualization
**Best Practice**: Help users understand command sequences and workflows

**Impact**:
- New users don't know where to start
- Complex workflows not documented
- Underutilization of advanced features

**Recommendation**:
Create commands:
- `/workflow:guide` - Interactive workflow selection
- `/workflow:map` - Visual command relationships
- `/workflow:examples` - Common workflow patterns

Add workflow examples to CLAUDE.md.

#### 6. Orchestration Complexity ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State**: 8 advanced orchestration commands with steep learning curve
**Best Practice**: Facade commands for common patterns

**Impact**:
- Advanced features underutilized
- Intimidating for new users
- Requires deep understanding to use

**Recommendation**:
Create facade commands:
- `/orchestrate:quick` - Simple workflow with defaults
- `/orchestrate:custom` - Advanced customization
- `/orchestration:dashboard` - Unified status/monitoring view

Keep low-level commands for power users.

#### 7. Missing Git/Collaboration Features ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

**Current State**: Git integration limited to auto-commits
**Best Practice**: Full git workflow support

**Impact**:
- Manual branch management required
- No PR creation workflow
- Missing collaboration features

**Recommendation**:
Add commands:
- `/git:feature <name>` - Create feature branch
- `/git:pr [title]` - Create pull request
- `/git:sync` - Sync with remote

#### 8. Limited Discovery Tools ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

**Current State**: Only list commands, no search or filtering
**Best Practice**: Rich discovery and search capabilities

**Impact**:
- Hard to find specific plans/reports
- No search across content
- Manual directory browsing needed

**Recommendation**:
Enhance list commands:
- `/discover:search <query>` - Full-text search across all specs
- `/discover:filter --tag=<tag>` - Filter by metadata
- `/discover:recent` - Show recent activity

#### 9. No Analytics/Metrics ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

**Current State**: No velocity or quality metrics
**Best Practice**: Track and improve over time

**Impact**:
- No insight into productivity
- Can't identify bottlenecks
- No trend analysis

**Recommendation**:
Add commands:
- `/metrics:velocity` - Implementation speed analysis
- `/metrics:quality` - Test pass rates, refactoring frequency
- `/metrics:trends` - Long-term improvement tracking
