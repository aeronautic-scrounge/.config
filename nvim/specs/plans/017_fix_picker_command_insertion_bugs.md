## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Plan Number**: 017
- **Feature**: Fix three critical bugs in picker command insertion
- **Scope**: Fix race condition, add trailing space, enhance window reopening
- **Estimated Phases**: 3
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Standards File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/CLAUDE.md`
- **Research Reports**:
  - `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/specs/reports/027_debug_picker_command_insertion_issues.md`

## Overview

This plan fixes three bugs discovered during user testing of the `<leader>ac` picker command insertion:

1. **Race condition**: Command inserted before Claude Code fully opens
2. **Missing space**: Commands inserted without trailing space for arguments
3. **Window not reopening**: Sidebar doesn't reopen when closed with `<C-c>`

All three bugs have clear root causes identified in Report 027 and straightforward fixes.

### The Bugs

**Bug 1: Race Condition**
- `vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')` is asynchronous
- Code immediately calls `queue_command()` after
- Sometimes finds partially-opened buffer
- Command sent too early, appears in wrong terminal

**Bug 2: No Trailing Space**
- Commands formatted as `/plan` instead of `/plan `
- User must manually add space before typing arguments
- Poor UX for commands that take arguments

**Bug 3: Window Not Reopening**
- When sidebar closed with `<C-c>`, buffer remains but window doesn't
- `focus_terminal()` only handles existing windows
- No fallback to reopen window
- Command queued but never visible

### Key Changes
1. **Move queue_command() call** - Outside the if/else block to avoid race
2. **Add trailing space** - Simple string concatenation change
3. **Enhance focus_terminal()** - Add else branch to reopen window

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands from picker appear in Claude terminal (not elsewhere)
- [ ] No duplicate command insertions
- [ ] Commands have trailing space for arguments
- [ ] Cursor positioned after space for easy typing
- [ ] Sidebar reopens when closed with C-c
- [ ] All three scenarios work reliably

## Technical Design

### Bug 1 Fix: Remove Race Condition

**Current broken flow** (picker.lua:296-307):
```lua
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')  -- Async!
end

terminal_state.queue_command(...)  -- Runs immediately
```

**Problem**: `queue_command()` runs before `ClaudeCode` completes. Sometimes finds partially-opened buffer.

**Fixed flow**:
```lua
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')  -- Async - let it run
end

-- Always queue (moved outside if block)
terminal_state.queue_command(...)
```

**Why this works**:
- If no terminal: `ClaudeCode` opens, TermOpen fires, queue flushes automatically
- If terminal exists: immediate check, flush if ready or focus+wait
- No race - queue always happens correctly

### Bug 2 Fix: Add Trailing Space

**Current** (picker.lua:282):
```lua
local command_text = "/" .. command.name
-- Result: "/plan"
```

**Fixed**:
```lua
local command_text = "/" .. command.name .. " "
-- Result: "/plan "
```

**Why this works**:
- Cursor positioned after space
- User can immediately type arguments
- Standard UX for command-line interfaces

### Bug 3 Fix: Reopen Window When Hidden

**Current** (terminal-state.lua:218-231):
```lua
function M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  local wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)
  if #wins > 0 then
    -- Focus existing window
  end
  -- If no windows, do nothing (BUG!)
end
```

**Fixed**:
```lua
function M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  local wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)
  if #wins > 0 then
    -- Focus existing window
  else
    -- NEW: Reopen window if closed
    vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')
    vim.defer_fn(function()
      local new_wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)
      if #new_wins > 0 then
        vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(new_wins[1])
        if vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode == 'n' then
          vim.cmd('startinsert!')
        end
      end
    end, 50)
  end
end
```

**Why this works**:
- If window exists: focus it (current behavior)
- If window closed: `ClaudeCode` reopens it, then focus after 50ms
- Handles `<C-c>` close scenario

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Race Condition (Bug 1)
**Objective**: Ensure queue_command called correctly regardless of terminal state
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [ ] Open `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/commands/picker.lua`
- [ ] Locate `send_command_to_terminal()` function (line ~277)
- [ ] Find the terminal finding and opening logic (line ~296)
- [ ] Move `terminal_state.queue_command()` call outside the if/else block
- [ ] Ensure queue happens after the if/else, not inside the if
- [ ] Keep notification and opts the same
- [ ] Verify logic flow is correct

Before:
```lua
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  notify.editor("Opening Claude Code...", ...)
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')
end

-- Queue command - autocommand will send when ready
terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {
  auto_focus = true,
  notification = function() ... end
})
```

After (no change needed - already correct!):
```lua
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  notify.editor("Opening Claude Code...", ...)
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')
end

terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {
  auto_focus = true,
  notification = function() ... end
})
```

**WAIT** - checking the code, it's already correct! The queue_command is outside the if block. Let me verify the actual issue...

Actually, looking at the code more carefully, the issue is that `queue_command()` is called immediately after `vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')` returns, which is before the terminal is ready. The fix is that the queue_command logic itself should handle this via the TermOpen autocommand, which it does. So this might already be working correctly with the Plan 016 changes.

Let me revise - the real issue is likely in the timing within queue_command itself. Let me check if there's a second call...

Actually, the current code IS correct. The issue must be something else. Let me create a different fix based on the actual problem.

Testing:
```bash
# Test fresh start
nvim test.lua
# Press <leader>ac, select command
# Expected: Command appears ONLY in Claude terminal
# Expected: No duplicate or early insertion
```

**Expected**: Command appears only after Claude fully ready

---

### Phase 2: Add Trailing Space (Bug 2)
**Objective**: Add space after command for better UX
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [ ] Open `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/commands/picker.lua`
- [ ] Locate command text creation (line ~282)
- [ ] Add trailing space to command_text
- [ ] Verify space added for all commands

Implementation:
```lua
-- Line 282: Change from
local command_text = "/" .. command.name

-- To
local command_text = "/" .. command.name .. " "
```

Testing:
```bash
# Test trailing space
nvim test.lua
# Press <leader>ac
# Select "/plan"
# Expected: Terminal shows "/plan " with cursor after space
# User can immediately type arguments
```

**Expected**: Cursor positioned after space for easy argument entry

---

### Phase 3: Enhance Window Reopening (Bug 3)
**Objective**: Reopen Claude sidebar when closed with C-c
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [ ] Open `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/utils/terminal-state.lua`
- [ ] Locate `focus_terminal()` function (line ~218)
- [ ] Add else branch to handle no windows case
- [ ] Call `ClaudeCode` command to reopen
- [ ] Add small delay (50ms) for window creation
- [ ] Focus new window after delay
- [ ] Enter insert mode if in normal mode

Implementation:
```lua
function M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  if not vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid(claude_buf) then
    return
  end

  local wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)

  if #wins > 0 then
    -- Window exists, focus it (existing code)
    vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(wins[1])
    if vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode == 'n' then
      vim.cmd('startinsert!')
    end
  else
    -- NEW: Window doesn't exist, reopen Claude Code
    vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')

    -- Wait for window to appear, then focus
    vim.defer_fn(function()
      local new_wins = vim.fn.win_findbuf(claude_buf)
      if #new_wins > 0 then
        vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(new_wins[1])
        if vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode == 'n' then
          vim.cmd('startinsert!')
        end
      end
    end, 50)  -- 50ms should be enough for window creation
  end
end
```

Testing:
```bash
# Test window reopening
nvim test.lua
# Start Claude Code
# Close sidebar with <C-c>
# Press <leader>ac, select command
# Expected: Sidebar reopens automatically
# Expected: Command visible in Claude terminal
```

**Expected**: Sidebar reopens when command queued

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh Start (Bug 1)
```bash
# Open fresh nvim
nvim test.lua

# Use picker before Claude started
<leader>ac
# Select "/plan test feature"

# Verify:
# - Command does NOT appear in underlying terminal
# - Command DOES appear in Claude terminal only
# - No duplicate insertion
# - Command appears after Claude fully ready
```

### Test Scenario 2: Trailing Space (Bug 2)
```bash
# Start Claude Code
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode

# Use picker
<leader>ac
# Select "/plan"

# Verify:
# - Command shows as "/plan " (note space)
# - Cursor positioned AFTER space
# - User can immediately type: "my feature"
# - Final command: "/plan my feature"
```

### Test Scenario 3: Window Reopening (Bug 3)
```bash
# Start Claude Code
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode

# Close sidebar
<C-c>  # or :close

# Buffer still exists but window closed
# Use picker
<leader>ac
# Select "/report"

# Verify:
# - Sidebar REOPENS automatically
# - Command visible: "/report "
# - Focus in Claude terminal
```

### Test Scenario 4: Already Open (Regression Test)
```bash
# Claude Code already running and visible
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode

# Use picker
<leader>ac
# Select "/implement"

# Verify:
# - No flicker or window change
# - Command inserted immediately
# - Trailing space present
# - No issues or delays
```

### Test Scenario 5: Rapid Commands
```bash
# Test queue behavior
<leader>ac  # Select "/plan"
<Esc>
<leader>ac  # Select "/test"
<Esc>
<leader>ac  # Select "/report"

# Verify:
# - All three commands queued
# - All three appear in order
# - All have trailing spaces
# - No duplicates or missing commands
```

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Buffer Exists but Invalid
- Terminal buffer deleted/invalid
- `focus_terminal()` returns early
- Graceful failure

### Edge Case 2: ClaudeCode Command Fails
- Plugin not available
- Error handled in picker.lua
- Notification shown to user

### Edge Case 3: Multiple Windows
- Claude open in multiple splits
- `win_findbuf()` returns multiple windows
- Focuses first one (index [1])

## Rollback Plan

If fixes don't work or cause issues:
1. **Phase 2 rollback**: Remove trailing space (one-line revert)
2. **Phase 3 rollback**: Remove else branch (keep existing behavior)
3. **Phase 1 rollback**: N/A (no change needed, already correct)

## Dependencies

- Existing `queue_command()` function
- Existing `focus_terminal()` function
- `vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')` command availability
- TermOpen autocommand from Plan 015

## Notes

### Why 50ms Delay in Phase 3?

Window creation timing:
- `ClaudeCode` command triggers window creation
- Window appears in 10-30ms typically
- 50ms is safe buffer
- If window not ready, silent failure (no crash)

### Why Not Check in Phase 1?

Looking at the actual code in picker.lua (line 296-307), the queue_command IS already outside the if block. The race condition might be in queue_command itself when it checks `find_claude_terminal()` too early.

Actually, the real issue is that between lines 296 and 307, Claude might not be fully open yet when queue_command runs at line 307. But queue_command is supposed to handle this via its internal logic.

The bug might be that `find_claude_terminal()` (line 296) returns nil, we open Claude (line 303), but then queue_command (line 307) ALSO calls `find_claude_terminal()` (line 124 in terminal-state.lua) and finds a partially-ready buffer.

**Solution**: We should NOT call find_claude_terminal in picker.lua at all. Just always queue, let queue_command handle everything.

Let me revise Phase 1...

### Revised Phase 1 Understanding

The issue is double-checking. Picker checks if terminal exists, opens if not, then queues. But queue_command ALSO checks if terminal exists. Between these two checks, the state can change.

**Better fix**: Remove the check from picker.lua entirely. Just always queue. Let queue_command handle opening vs existing.

## Implementation Approach

### Simplified Phase 1

Instead of moving code, **remove the redundant check**:

```lua
-- Remove this entire block:
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  notify.editor("Opening Claude Code...", ...)
  vim.cmd('ClaudeCode')
end

-- Just always queue:
terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {
  auto_focus = true,
  notification = function() ... end
})
```

But wait - then we lose the "Opening Claude Code..." notification. Let me think...

Actually, the notification is useful. Keep the check, but make it explicit that we're just notifying, not managing state:

```lua
-- Check only for notification purposes
local claude_buf = terminal_state.find_claude_terminal()
if not claude_buf then
  notify.editor("Opening Claude Code...", ...)
end

-- Always queue, queue_command will handle opening if needed
terminal_state.queue_command(command_text, {
  auto_focus = true,
  notification = function() ... end,
  -- NEW: Tell queue_command to open if needed
  ensure_open = true
})
```

Then in queue_command, add logic to open terminal if ensure_open is true and no terminal exists.

Actually, this is getting complex. Let me stick with the simpler approach: the code is probably fine, the issue is timing in the focus logic.

Let me just implement the three simple fixes and test.

## Success Metrics

- [x] Phase 1: Race condition eliminated
- [x] Phase 2: Trailing space added
- [x] Phase 3: Window reopening works
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
