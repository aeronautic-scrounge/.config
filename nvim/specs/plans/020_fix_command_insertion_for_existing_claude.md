## Overview

Plan 018's hook-based solution works perfectly for fresh starts but fails when Claude is already running. The issue is simple: when terminal exists, we need to **ensure window is visible and flush immediately** - no delays or complex timing needed.

### Current Behavior

**Works ✓**: Fresh start → SessionStart hook → flush
**Fails ✗**: Claude running → queue_command does nothing

### Desired Behavior

**All cases should work**:
1. Fresh start → SessionStart hook → flush (already works)
2. Claude running, window visible → flush immediately
3. Claude running, window closed → reopen window, flush immediately

### Key Insight

User is correct: **No delays needed!** If Claude has started (buffer exists), the terminal is already initialized and ready. We just need to:
1. Ensure window is open
2. Flush the queue
3. Done

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Commands inserted when Claude already running
- [ ] Commands inserted when Claude window closed (reopens automatically)
- [ ] Fresh start still works (SessionStart hook)
- [ ] No delays, no polling, no complex timing
- [ ] Clean, simple code

## Technical Design

### Current Code (Broken)

```lua
-- terminal-state.lua:136-142
if M.is_terminal_ready(claude_buf) then
  state = M.State.READY
  M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
end
-- If not ready, SessionStart hook or TextChanged will handle it
```

**Problem**: If `is_terminal_ready()` returns false, nothing happens!

### Root Issue

We're checking `is_terminal_ready()` which does pattern matching for prompts. But if Claude is running, it's ready - we don't need to check for patterns!

**The fix is simple**: If buffer exists, just flush. Pattern matching is unnecessary.

### Fixed Code (Simple)

```lua
-- Terminal exists - ensure visible and flush
M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)  -- Opens window if closed
M.flush_queue(claude_buf)     -- Send commands immediately
```

That's it! No readiness checks, no delays, just:
1. Focus (which handles window opening)
2. Flush (which sends commands)

### Why This Works

**If Claude started**:
- Buffer exists
- Terminal is initialized
- Can send commands immediately
- No need to wait for anything

**If window closed**:
- `focus_terminal()` has else branch that calls `ClaudeCode`
- Window opens
- Commands sent
- Works!

**If fresh start**:
- Buffer doesn't exist
- `queue_command()` returns early
- SessionStart hook handles it
- Still works!

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify queue_command()

**Objective**: Remove unnecessary readiness check, just flush when terminal exists
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [ ] Open `/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/ai/claude/utils/terminal-state.lua`
- [ ] Locate `queue_command()` function (line ~114)
- [ ] Find the "terminal exists" branch (line ~135)
- [ ] Replace readiness check with simple focus + flush
- [ ] Remove unnecessary state updates
- [ ] Test all scenarios

**Before** (lines 135-142):
```lua
-- Terminal exists - check if ready
if M.is_terminal_ready(claude_buf) then
  state = M.State.READY
  M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
end
// If not ready, SessionStart hook or TextChanged will handle it
```

**After** (simplified):
```lua
-- Terminal exists - ensure visible and flush immediately
M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
```

**Why this is better**:
- No pattern matching needed
- No conditionals
- No "hope something else handles it"
- Just do it!

**Lines removed**: ~5 lines
**Lines added**: 2 lines
**Net**: -3 lines, much simpler

Testing:
```bash
# Test 1: Claude already running
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode
# Wait for prompt
# Switch back
<leader>ac
# Select command
# Expected: Immediate insertion

# Test 2: Claude window closed
:ClaudeCode  # Close it
<leader>ac
# Select command
# Expected: Reopens, command inserted

# Test 3: Fresh start (regression test)
# No Claude running
<leader>ac
# Select command
# Expected: Opens Claude, command inserted via hook
```

**Expected**: All three scenarios work immediately

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenario 1: Claude Running, Window Visible

```bash
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode  # Start Claude
# Wait for prompt to appear
<leader>ac   # Use picker
# Select "/plan test"
```

**Expected**:
- Command appears immediately: `/plan `
- No delay
- Cursor after space

### Test Scenario 2: Claude Running, Window Closed

```bash
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode  # Start Claude
# Wait for it to load
:ClaudeCode  # Close window (toggle)
<leader>ac   # Use picker
# Select "/report test"
```

**Expected**:
- Window reopens
- Command appears immediately: `/report `
- No delay

### Test Scenario 3: Fresh Start (Regression)

```bash
nvim test.lua
# Don't start Claude manually
<leader>ac
# Select "/implement"
```

**Expected**:
- Claude opens
- SessionStart hook fires
- Command inserted: `/implement `
- Still works as before

### Test Scenario 4: Rapid Commands

```bash
nvim test.lua
:ClaudeCode
<leader>ac  # Select /plan
<Esc>
<leader>ac  # Select /test
<Esc>
<leader>ac  # Select /report
```

**Expected**:
- All three commands queued
- All three appear in order
- No duplicates
- No delays

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Buffer Exists But Invalid

**Scenario**: Terminal buffer was deleted

**Behavior**:
- `find_claude_terminal()` returns nil
- Takes fresh start path
- Opens new Claude
- Works

**Handled**: Yes, by existing code

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Windows

**Scenario**: Claude open in multiple splits

**Behavior**:
- `focus_terminal()` focuses first window
- Commands sent to that terminal
- Works

**Handled**: Yes, `win_findbuf()` returns first window

### Edge Case 3: Command Queue Empty

**Scenario**: `flush_queue()` called with empty queue

**Behavior**:
- `while #pending_commands > 0` loop doesn't execute
- No-op, harmless

**Handled**: Yes, existing code handles this

## Why This is Better Than Delays

### Delay Approach (What We Avoided)

```lua
else
  M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
  vim.defer_fn(function()
    M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
  end, 200)
end
```

**Problems**:
- Arbitrary delay (why 200ms?)
- User waits unnecessarily
- Code complexity
- What if 200ms isn't enough?

### Immediate Approach (This Plan)

```lua
M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
```

**Benefits**:
- Instant (no waiting)
- Simple (2 lines)
- Deterministic (no timing guesses)
- Always works (buffer exists = ready)

## Why Pattern Matching Was Wrong

### Old Logic

"Check if terminal ready by looking for prompt patterns"

**Problem**: Prompt might not be visible if:
- User scrolled up
- Loading message shown
- Error displayed
- Terminal cleared

### New Logic

"If buffer exists, terminal is ready"

**Why it's correct**:
- Buffer only exists if terminal started
- Terminal startup is fast (10-50ms)
- By the time Neovim sees the buffer, terminal is functional
- No need to check for specific patterns

## Rollback Plan

If this doesn't work:
1. Revert commit
2. Go back to Plan 018 state
3. Consider Report 030's delay-based fallback

But this should work because the logic is sound:
- Buffer exists = terminal initialized = can send commands

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- `focus_terminal()` - Handles window opening
- `flush_queue()` - Sends queued commands
- SessionStart hook - Fresh start case

### No External Dependencies

This fix is entirely self-contained in `terminal-state.lua`.

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Comments

Update `queue_command()` docstring:

```lua
--- Queue command to be sent when terminal is ready
--- For fresh start: SessionStart hook flushes queue
--- For existing terminal: Immediate flush (terminal already ready)
```

### No User Documentation Needed

This is a bug fix, not a new feature. Users don't need to know about internal timing changes.

## Notes

### Why User Was Right

The user correctly identified that delays are unnecessary:

> "I don't think delays are needed. If claude code has been started, all that is needed is that it be opened and the command be inserted."

This is exactly right. The complexity in Plan 018 came from overthinking the problem. The solution is simple:
1. **Buffer doesn't exist**: Let SessionStart hook handle it
2. **Buffer exists**: It's ready, just send

### Why This Wasn't Done in Plan 018

Plan 018 followed Report 028's recommendation too literally:
- Report said "hook for readiness signal"
- We implemented hook
- But forgot the obvious case: **buffer exists = ready**

We over-engineered by adding pattern matching to check "readiness" when buffer existence is sufficient.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Simple is better**: Two lines vs complex readiness checks
2. **Trust the basics**: Buffer exists = terminal initialized
3. **User intuition matters**: User saw the simple solution we missed
4. **Remove, don't add**: Fix by removing complexity, not adding delays

## Success Metrics

- [x] Plan created with single simple phase
- [ ] Code simplified (remove readiness check)
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] No delays introduced
- [ ] Code is cleaner than before

## Conclusion

The fix is embarrassingly simple: **just flush when buffer exists**. No delays, no pattern matching, no complexity. The user was absolutely right.

**Before** (complex, doesn't work):
```lua
if M.is_terminal_ready(claude_buf) then
  // complex checks
end
// nothing happens if not ready
```

**After** (simple, works):
```lua
M.focus_terminal(claude_buf)
M.flush_queue(claude_buf)
```

This is what good engineering looks like: solving the problem with the simplest possible solution.
