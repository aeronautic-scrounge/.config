# Draft Field Sync Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the draft field synchronization refactor completed on 2025-07-11.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Metadata Synchronization
1. **draft_manager_v2.lua**:
   - Modified `sync_remote` to reload fresh metadata from local storage before syncing
   - Ensures the sync engine receives the most up-to-date field values

2. **sync_engine.lua**:
   - Added validation for email fields with proper defaults
   - Enhanced debug logging for validation failures

### Phase 2: Initial Save
1. **email_composer.lua**:
   - Restored immediate save functionality
   - Added two-step save: first `save_local` to capture template, then full save
   - Ensures initial draft has all template values (From, To, Subject, etc.)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Field Updates
1. **draft_manager_v2.lua - _update_metadata_from_content**:
   - Extracts ALL fields including From
   - Handles multi-line headers with proper continuation parsing
   - Separates body content from headers for clean storage
   - Updates all metadata fields, not just some

2. **draft_manager_v2.lua - save_local**:
   - Fixed to use extracted body content instead of full buffer content
   - Ensures content field contains only the email body

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Created comprehensive test script `test_draft_field_sync.lua` with tests for:
   - Initial draft creation captures all fields
   - Field updates are synced on save
   - Empty fields are handled correctly
   - Multi-line headers work properly
   - Body content is separated from headers

### Phase 5: Documentation
1. Updated `DRAFT_SYSTEM_V2.md`:
   - Added full field sync to key features
   - Added troubleshooting section for field sync issues
   - Documented common problems and solutions

## Key Improvements

1. **Full Field Sync**: All email fields (To, From, Cc, Bcc, Subject) now sync properly
2. **Content Separation**: Headers stored in metadata, body stored separately
3. **Better Parsing**: Multi-line headers and continuation lines handled correctly
4. **Initial Values**: Draft creation captures template values immediately
5. **Fresh Data**: Remote sync always uses the latest field values

## Technical Details

### Before
- `_update_metadata_from_content` only updated some fields
- `sync_remote` used stale metadata
- Body content included headers
- From field was not extracted

### After
- All fields extracted and updated
- Fresh metadata loaded before sync
- Clean separation of headers and body
- Proper multi-line header support

## Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```vim
:lua require('neotex.plugins.tools.himalaya.scripts.features.test_draft_field_sync').run()
```

## Usage
1. Create a new draft - all template fields are saved
2. Edit any field and save (Ctrl+S) - changes sync to remote
3. Close and reopen draft - all fields preserved
4. Multi-line subjects and long addresses work correctly

## Rollback
If issues arise, the changes can be reverted as they are isolated to:
- 3 functions in draft_manager_v2.lua
- 1 function in sync_engine.lua
- 1 function in email_composer.lua

No data migration or structural changes were required.
