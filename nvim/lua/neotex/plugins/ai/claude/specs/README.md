# Claude AI Specifications and Documentation

Implementation plans, research reports, and implementation summaries for the Claude AI integration module. This directory contains comprehensive documentation of features, investigations, and completed implementations.

## Directory Structure

```
specs/
├── plans/          # Implementation plans for features
├── reports/        # Research and debug reports
├── summaries/      # Post-implementation summaries
└── RND/            # Research and development notes
```

## Plans

Implementation plans that guide feature development with detailed phases, testing strategies, and success criteria.

### Numbering Convention
Plans use three-digit incremental numbering: `001_plan_name.md`, `002_plan_name.md`, etc.

### Plan Structure
```markdown
# Feature Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- Date, plan number, scope
- Research reports referenced
- Estimated phases and complexity

## Overview
Feature description and goals

## Success Criteria
Checklist of completion requirements

## Technical Design
Architecture decisions and approach

## Implementation Phases
Detailed phase-by-phase tasks

## Testing Strategy
Test approach and scenarios

## Dependencies
External and internal dependencies
```

### Key Plans
- **018_refactor_to_hook_based_readiness_detection.md** - Hook-based command insertion
- **020_fix_command_insertion_for_existing_claude.md** - Simplify queue_command timing
- **021_fix_mode_and_timing_issues_comprehensive.md** - Complete mode/timing fixes

## Reports

Research reports and debug investigations that inform implementation decisions.

### Report Types
1. **Research Reports**: Technical analysis of features or approaches
2. **Debug Reports**: Root cause analysis of issues
3. **Architecture Reports**: System design documentation

### Numbering Convention
Reports use three-digit incremental numbering: `001_report_name.md`, `002_report_name.md`, etc.

### Report Structure
```markdown
# Report Title

## Metadata
- Date, report number, type
- Related plans/reports

## Problem Statement / Research Question
What we're investigating

## Investigation / Analysis
Detailed findings and evidence

## Conclusions
Key takeaways and recommendations

## Recommendations
Next steps or implementation guidance
```

### Key Reports
- **028_claude_code_hooks_for_terminal_readiness.md** - SessionStart hook research
- **030_debug_hook_solution_works_only_fresh_start.md** - Hook timing issues
- **031_debug_hook_command_appears_in_claude_terminal.md** - Remote-send analysis
- **032_debug_remote_expr_and_mode_issues.md** - Comprehensive mode/timing root cause

## Summaries

Post-implementation documentation linking plans to executed code with lessons learned.

### Summary Structure
```markdown
# Implementation Summary: Feature Name

## Metadata
- Date completed
- Plan executed
- Reports referenced

## Implementation Overview
What was implemented

## Key Changes
Major modifications made

## Test Results
Testing outcomes and coverage

## Lessons Learned
Insights and best practices
```

### Naming Convention
Summaries match their plan numbers: `021_implementation_summary.md` corresponds to `021_fix_mode_and_timing_issues_comprehensive.md`

## RND (Research and Development)

Exploratory notes, experiments, and prototypes that don't fit into formal plans or reports.

### Usage
- Quick prototypes and experiments
- Brainstorming and design notes
- Temporary investigation files
- Ideas for future features

## Workflow

### Planning Phase
1. Research the feature/issue → Create Report
2. Design the solution → Create Plan
3. Review and approve plan

### Implementation Phase
1. Execute plan phase-by-phase
2. Update plan with `[COMPLETED]` markers
3. Test each phase thoroughly

### Documentation Phase
1. Generate Implementation Summary
2. Link plan, reports, and summary
3. Document lessons learned

## Integration with /claude Commands

These specifications work with Claude Code slash commands:

### Planning Commands
- `/plan <feature>` - Create implementation plan
- `/plan <feature> [reports...]` - Plan with research context
- `/list-plans` - List all plans
- `/update-plan <path>` - Update existing plan

### Research Commands
- `/report <topic>` - Create research report
- `/list-reports` - List all reports
- `/update-report <path>` - Update existing report

### Implementation Commands
- `/implement [plan]` - Execute implementation plan
- `/resume-implement [plan] [phase]` - Resume from specific phase
- `/list-summaries` - List implementation summaries

### Debugging Commands
- `/debug <issue>` - Create debug report
- `/debug <issue> [reports...]` - Debug with context

## Document Standards

### Formatting
- Use UTF-8 encoding (no emojis in content)
- Markdown with proper heading hierarchy
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- ASCII diagrams using box-drawing characters

### Structure
- Clear metadata section at top
- Consistent heading levels
- Cross-references to related docs
- Navigation links at bottom

### Content
- Concise, technical language
- Code examples where applicable
- Test scenarios and results
- Clear success criteria

## Cross-References

### Plan → Report
Plans reference research reports that informed their design:
```markdown
## Research Reports
- specs/reports/028_claude_code_hooks.md
- specs/reports/032_mode_issues.md
```

### Summary → Plan + Reports
Summaries link to both the plan executed and reports used:
```markdown
## Plan Executed
[021_fix_mode_and_timing_issues](../plans/021_fix_mode_and_timing_issues_comprehensive.md)

## Reports Referenced
- [028_hooks](../reports/028_claude_code_hooks_for_terminal_readiness.md)
- [032_mode_issues](../reports/032_debug_remote_expr_and_mode_issues.md)
```
