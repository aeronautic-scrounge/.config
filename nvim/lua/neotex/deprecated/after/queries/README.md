# Deprecated Tree-Sitter Queries

Legacy tree-sitter query definitions.

## Purpose

This directory contains deprecated tree-sitter queries that have been replaced by updated implementations or removed entirely.

## Contents

### ecma/

Legacy ECMAScript (JavaScript/TypeScript) tree-sitter queries.

See [ecma/README.md](ecma/README.md) for details.

## Migration Status

These queries are **not loaded** by tree-sitter. Current queries are managed through:

- NeoVim's standard query locations
- Plugin-provided queries
- Updated custom queries in active configuration
