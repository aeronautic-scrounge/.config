## Implementation Overview

### Key Findings from Research

**Current State**:
- **Largest Files**:
  - orchestrate.md: 6,341 lines (197KB, 200 sections)
  - implement.md: 1,803 lines (69KB, 70 sections)
  - auto-analysis-utils.sh: 1,755 lines (58KB, 19 functions)
  - parse-adaptive-plan.sh: 1,298 lines (36KB, 33 functions)
  - convert-docs.sh: 1,502 lines (41KB, 29 functions)

- **Complexity Hotspots**:
  - orchestrate.md: 4:1 documentation-to-code ratio creates navigation difficulty
  - implement.md: 70 sections covering multiple distinct responsibilities
  - Overlapping utility responsibilities (artifact-utils.sh and auto-analysis-utils.sh)
  - Repeated utility sourcing patterns across 9+ commands

- **Modularization Opportunities**:
  - Extract ~2,400 lines of documentation from orchestrate.md to shared sections
  - Extract ~530 lines from implement.md to shared sections
  - Consolidate artifact management functions from 2 utility files
  - Create checkpoint initialization template used by 9+ commands

**Industry Best Practices (2025)**:
- **File Size**: 250-line threshold (Code Climate standard)
- **Function Size**: 25 lines default, max 100 lines
- **Modularization**: Template-based composition, Single Responsibility Principle
- **Command Pattern**: One command = one well-defined task with single execute() method
- **Testing**: Extract business logic from CLI scripts for testability

**Proven Patterns in Codebase**:
- **agents/shared/**: Successfully reduced files by 28% through reference-based composition
- **Bash Utilities**: Effectively delegate procedural logic from markdown prompts
- **Template System**: Demonstrates composition without duplication using YAML variables

### Technical Decisions

**1. Reference-Based Composition Pattern**
- Create `.claude/commands/shared/` directory parallel to `.claude/agents/shared/`
- Extract reusable documentation to focused markdown files (200-400 lines each)
- Commands reference sections using relative links: `See [Section](shared/file.md)`
- Preserve 50-100 word summaries before references for context
- **Rationale**: Proven pattern in agents/shared/, requires no tooling changes

**2. Documentation Extraction Priorities**

**High Priority (orchestrate.md)**:
- Workflow phases (~800 lines) → `shared/workflow-phases.md`
- Error recovery (~400 lines) → `shared/error-recovery.md`
- Context management (~300 lines) → `shared/context-management.md`
- Agent coordination (~500 lines) → `shared/agent-coordination.md`
- Examples (~400 lines) → `shared/orchestrate-examples.md`
- **Total Extraction**: ~2,400 lines (62% reduction)

**Medium Priority (implement.md)**:
- Adaptive planning (~200 lines) → `shared/adaptive-planning.md`
- Progressive structure (~150 lines) → `shared/progressive-structure.md`
- Phase execution (~180 lines) → `shared/phase-execution.md`
- **Total Extraction**: ~530 lines (29% reduction)

**3. Utility Consolidation**
- Merge artifact-utils.sh and auto-analysis-utils.sh → artifact-management.sh
- Extract checkpoint initialization pattern → checkpoint-template.sh
- Update 9+ commands to use shared checkpoint template
- Maintain deprecated utilities for 1 version (backward compatibility)

**4. File Size Targets**

After refactoring:
| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| orchestrate.md | 6,341 lines | ~1,200 lines | 81% |
| implement.md | 1,803 lines | ~700 lines | 61% |
| commands/shared/*.md | N/A | 200-400 lines each | N/A |
| lib/*.sh | >1,500 lines | <1,000 lines | 33% |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis
- Create `commands/shared/` directory structure
- Inventory extraction candidates from orchestrate.md and implement.md
- Run baseline tests for validation

### Phase 2: Extract orchestrate.md Documentation
- Extract 5 major documentation sections (~2,400 lines)
- Update orchestrate.md with references and summaries
- Reduce from 6,341 to ~1,200 lines

### Phase 3: Extract implement.md Documentation
- Extract 3 documentation sections (~530 lines)
- Update implement.md with references
- Reduce from 1,803 to ~700 lines

### Phase 4: Consolidate Utility Libraries
- Merge artifact-utils.sh and auto-analysis-utils.sh
- Create checkpoint-template.sh
- Update 9+ commands to use templates
- Document utilities in lib/README.md

### Phase 5: Documentation, Testing, and Validation
- Update all README files with new architecture
- Create test_command_references.sh for link validation
- Run complete test suite (≥80% coverage)
- Validate success criteria

## Performance Metrics

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Parallel Research**: Running 3 research agents concurrently saved ~8 minutes
- **Proven Patterns**: Leveraging existing agents/shared/ pattern provided concrete example
- **Research Synthesis**: 200-word research summary provided sufficient context for planning
- **Complexity Analysis**: Detailed file metrics (line counts, section counts) enabled precise targets

### Challenges Encountered
- **Scope Definition**: Initial request was broad ("some files are too long")—research phase successfully identified specific problem files and metrics
- **Pattern Discovery**: Finding existing modularization patterns (agents/shared/) required codebase exploration
- **Standards Research**: 2025 industry standards required web search to find current recommendations

### Recommendations for Future

**Implementation Recommendations**:
1. Start with orchestrate.md (largest impact: 81% reduction)
2. Test extensively after Phase 2 (highest risk phase)
3. Maintain deprecated utilities for 1 version (safety net)
4. Use test_command_references.sh continuously during refactor
5. Consider extending pattern to other large files (setup.md: 911 lines, convert-docs.sh: 1,502 lines)

**Workflow Optimization**:
1. Parallel research phase was highly effective—use for all complex investigations
2. Research synthesis (200 words max) kept context manageable
3. Planning phase benefited from structured research findings
4. Consider creating reusable "refactoring analysis template" for future similar tasks

**Architecture Evolution**:
1. Reference-based composition scales well (proven in agents/shared/)
2. May explore preprocessing tools (gomplate, Template Toolkit) if reference pattern becomes insufficient
3. Utility consolidation should be ongoing maintenance practice
4. File size thresholds (250 lines) should be enforced in code review

## Notes

### Refactoring Philosophy
This plan follows CLAUDE.md Development Philosophy:
- **Clean-Break Refactors**: Prioritizes system coherence over backward compatibility
- **No Historical Markers**: Main documentation describes current state only
- **Present-Focused**: Migration guide separate from architectural docs
- **Quality First**: Well-designed modular system over compromise

### Success Metrics
Expected after implementation:
- orchestrate.md: 81% reduction (6,341 → ~1,200 lines)
- implement.md: 61% reduction (1,803 → ~700 lines)
- commands/shared/: 8-10 reusable sections
- lib/: Consolidated utilities <1,000 lines per file
- Tests: ≥80% coverage maintained
- Similar impact to agents/shared/ (28% file reduction)

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Breaking existing commands → extensive testing, deprecated utilities
- **Medium Risk**: Over-extraction → preserve summaries before references
- **Low Risk**: File size targets → iterative extraction if needed

### Next Steps
1. Review implementation plan with stakeholders
2. Run baseline tests to establish current state: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
3. Execute Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis
4. Begin Phase 2: Extract orchestrate.md (highest impact)

### Context for Future Reference
This refactor addresses technical debt accumulated as commands grew organically. The orchestrate.md file evolved from ~2,000 lines to 6,341 lines through addition of features (dry-run, dashboard, parallel execution, error recovery). The 4:1 documentation-to-code ratio indicates documentation should be extracted while preserving command functionality.

The proven success of agents/shared/ (28% reduction) demonstrates that reference-based composition works well in this codebase. The same pattern applied to commands should yield similar or better results given the higher documentation-to-code ratio.
