## Implementation Overview

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Foundation and Command Structure
- YAML frontmatter with tool permissions (Task, TodoWrite, Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob)
- Workflow analysis and parsing framework
- Phase identification logic for research/planning/implementation/debugging/documentation
- Workflow state management with minimal orchestrator context
- TodoWrite integration for progress tracking

#### 2. Research Phase Coordination (Parallel Execution)
- Research topic identification with complexity-based strategy
- Parallel Task invocation for 2-4 simultaneous research agents
- Fan-out/fan-in coordination pattern
- Research synthesis logic (max 200-word summaries)
- Context minimization (<30% orchestrator usage)
- Checkpoint system after research completion

#### 3. Planning and Implementation Integration
- Planning phase with research context injection
- Task invocation wrapping /plan command
- Plan path extraction and validation
- Implementation phase with complexity-based execution strategy
- Task invocation wrapping /implement command
- Implementation status extraction (tests, files, commits)
- Dual checkpoint system (success/failure scenarios)

#### 4. Error Recovery and Debugging Loop
- 6 error type classifications with specific detection patterns
- Automatic recovery strategies:
  * Timeout errors: extend, split, reassign (3 retries)
  * Tool access errors: verify, reduce toolset (2 retries)
  * Validation failures: clarify, simplify, extract (3 retries)
  * Integration errors: retry, workaround (2 retries)
  * Context overflow prevention: compact, summarize, degrade
- 3-iteration debugging loop with /debug integration
- Debug report generation and fix application cycle
- Checkpoint-based rollback and recovery
- Error history tracking for learning
- Manual intervention escalation after retry limits

#### 5. Documentation and Workflow Completion
- Documentation phase with comprehensive context gathering
- Task invocation wrapping /document command
- Workflow summary template with complete metrics tracking
- Cross-referencing system (reports ↔ plan ↔ summary)
- Performance metrics calculation
- Final checkpoint with complete workflow state
- User-facing completion message

### Technical Decisions

**Supervisor Pattern Adoption**:
- Rationale: Validated by 2025 research showing 50% performance improvement through proper context management
- Implementation: Centralized orchestrator with minimal state, specialized subagents with comprehensive context
- Result: Context usage maintained <30% while providing full task context to workers

**Task Tool for Subagent Invocation**:
- Rationale: Native Claude Code mechanism with isolated context windows
- Implementation: General-purpose subagent type with focused prompts
- Result: Clean separation of concerns, parallel execution support

**Checkpoint-Based Recovery**:
- Rationale: Industry standard for long-running orchestrated workflows
- Implementation: Save after each successful phase, rollback on failure
- Result: Workflow resilience with partial work preservation

**Context Minimization Strategy**:
- Rationale: LangChain 2025 research shows context clutter has "outsized impacts on agent reliability"
- Implementation: Store summaries/paths only, forward message pattern, no routing logic to subagents
- Result: Orchestrator maintains minimal state while subagents have full context
