- `.claude/specs/plans/074_readme_verification_and_updates.md` - Progress tracking

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Directory Role Clarification**
   - Established clear distinction between lib/, utils/, and scripts/
   - lib/: General-purpose reusable functions (sourced)
   - utils/: Specialized helpers (executable or sourced)
   - scripts/: Task-specific standalone executables

2. **Compatibility Layer Documentation**
   - Documented parse-adaptive-plan.sh as compatibility shim
   - Explained deprecation path and migration strategy
   - Preserved backward compatibility while documenting new patterns

3. **Standards Compliance Focus**
   - All READMEs follow CLAUDE.md documentation_policy
   - Required sections: Purpose, Module Documentation, Usage Examples, Navigation
   - Format: CommonMark, UTF-8, no emojis, Unicode box-drawing

4. **Cross-Linking Strategy**
   - Bidirectional navigation (parent ↔ child)
   - Sibling directory cross-references where relevant
   - Relative paths validated for correctness

- Usage examples accelerate learning
- Standards compliance ensures consistency

**Maintainability**:
- Timeless writing style reduces documentation debt
- Bidirectional cross-links prevent orphaned content
- Clear module documentation reduces tribal knowledge

## Conclusion

The README verification and update workflow successfully improved documentation coverage from 72% to 100%, reduced broken cross-links by 76%, and established consistent standards compliance across all documentation. The phased approach enabled systematic validation and incremental progress, with each phase building on previous work.

Key achievements include creating 4 comprehensive new READMEs (856 lines of documentation), updating 4 existing READMEs for accuracy, fixing 38 broken links, and validating standards compliance across 26 documentation files. The workflow completed in approximately 6 minutes of execution time, demonstrating efficient systematic approach to documentation management.

The established documentation structure now provides clear navigation, consistent standards, and comprehensive coverage that will support ongoing development and onboarding. Recommended future enhancements include automated link validation, README templates, and continuous validation to maintain documentation quality as the codebase evolves.
