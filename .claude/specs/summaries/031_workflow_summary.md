## Implementation Overview

### Research Findings Summary

**Current State Analysis** (Agent 1):
- Three commands are documentation-only (230-235 lines each)
- No executable metadata (command-type, allowed-tools)
- Share 80% logic (collapse commands)
- Use progressive structure operations and metadata management

**expand-phase Pattern Analysis** (Agent 2):
- 1113-line workflow command with complexity detection
- Agent integration via behavioral injection
- 5-step synthesis (research → 300-500+ line specs)
- Quality checklists and validation standards

**Progressive Planning Structure** (Agent 3):
- Three levels: 0 (single file), 1 (phase expansion), 2 (stage expansion)
- Commands use parse-adaptive-plan.sh utilities
- Metadata tracking: Structure Level, Expanded Phases/Stages
- Bidirectional operations (expand ↔ collapse)

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Shared Utilities First** (Phase 1)
- Extract common collapse logic to `.claude/lib/progressive-planning-utils.sh`
- Reduces duplication (80% shared code)
- Functions: detect_last_item(), merge_markdown_sections(), update_expansion_metadata(), atomic_operation()
- Enables parallel collapse command development

**2. Stage-Level Complexity Thresholds**
- Adapted from phase-level (expand-phase) to stage-level (expand-stage)
- Thresholds: >3 implementation steps (vs >5 tasks), ≥8 files (vs ≥10 files)
- Keywords: "parallel", "concurrent", "distributed", "integration"
- Most stages simple (direct expansion), complex stages use agents

**3. Agent Integration for expand-stage Only**
- Collapse operations are deterministic (no research needed)
- expand-stage uses general-purpose + behavioral injection (like expand-phase)
- Target output: 200-400 line stage specs (smaller than 300-500+ phase specs)
- Maintains consistency across progressive planning commands

**4. Three-Way Metadata Synchronization** (collapse-stage)
- Updates stage file, phase file, and main plan metadata
- Atomic operations with rollback capability
- Comprehensive validation to prevent corruption
- Highest risk area - requires thorough testing

### Technical Decisions

**Command Metadata**:
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob  # expand-stage includes Glob
argument-hint: <plan/phase-path> <phase/stage-num>
description: [Operation description]
command-type: workflow
---
```

**Complexity Detection** (expand-stage):
```bash
# Stage-level metrics
implementation_count=$(count_implementation_steps "$stage_content")
file_refs=$(count_file_references "$stage_content")
unique_dirs=$(count_unique_directories "$stage_content")
has_complex_keywords=$(check_keywords "$stage_content" "parallel|concurrent|distributed|integration")

# Threshold comparison
if [[ $implementation_count -gt 3 ]] || [[ $file_refs -ge 8 ]] || [[ $unique_dirs -gt 1 ]] || [[ $has_complex_keywords -gt 0 ]]; then
  is_complex=true
fi
```

**Synthesis Process** (expand-stage):
1. Extract key findings (file:line refs, patterns, recommendations)
2. Map findings to implementation steps
3. Generate concrete code examples
4. Create testing strategy
5. Write detailed implementation guide
6. Target: 200-400 lines for complex stages

**Quality Standards**:
- All commands get quality checklists
- Content preservation validation (collapse operations)
- Metadata consistency checks (three-way for collapse-stage)
- Atomic operations with rollback
- Error handling with graceful fallback

## Implementation Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Shared Utilities Extraction (Medium)
**Objective**: Create reusable utility library for collapse operations

**Key Tasks**:
- Create `.claude/lib/progressive-planning-utils.sh`
- Implement detect_last_item(), merge_markdown_sections(), update_expansion_metadata(), atomic_operation()
- Comprehensive function documentation
- Unit testing of shared utilities

**Expected Outcome**: Reusable library reduces code duplication, well-tested foundation for collapse commands

### Phase 2: Refactor /collapse-phase (Medium)
**Objective**: Apply expand-phase patterns to collapse-phase command

**Key Tasks**:
- Add executable metadata
- Restructure with clear process steps
- Integrate shared utilities
- Add quality checklist and error handling
- Create comprehensive test suite

**Expected Outcome**: collapse-phase follows expand-phase structural pattern with shared utilities

### Phase 3: Refactor /collapse-stage (Medium)
**Objective**: Apply expand-phase patterns to collapse-stage command with three-way synchronization

**Key Tasks**:
- Add executable metadata
- Implement three-way metadata updates (stage, phase, main plan)
- Integrate shared utilities (stage-level adaptation)
- Add quality checklist and error handling
- Create comprehensive test suite

**Expected Outcome**: collapse-stage handles complex metadata synchronization correctly

### Phase 4: Refactor /expand-stage with Agent Integration (High)
**Objective**: Transform expand-stage into full workflow command with agents

**Key Tasks**:
- Add executable metadata
- Implement complexity detection (stage-level thresholds)
- Add agent selection logic (research-specialist, code-reviewer, plan-architect)
- Document agent invocation pattern with behavioral injection
- Implement synthesis process (research → detailed spec)
- Add quality checklist and section templates
- Create comprehensive test suite

**Expected Outcome**: expand-stage follows expand-phase pattern comprehensively with stage-level adaptations

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Medium)
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing and documentation completion

**Key Tasks**:
- Create test suites for all three commands (≥80% coverage)
- Integration testing (full workflow: L0→L1→L2→L1→L0)
- Update all documentation (progressive-planning-guide, agent-integration-guide, agents README)
- Create usage examples
- Performance benchmarking
- Backward compatibility validation

**Expected Outcome**: All tests passing, documentation complete, backward compatibility verified

## Performance Metrics

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Parallel research**: Three agents researching different aspects simultaneously saved time
- **Synthesis-based planning**: Research findings directly informed plan structure
- **Progressive approach**: Phases ordered to reduce risk (shared utils → simple commands → complex command)
- **Reference implementation**: expand-phase (Plan 030) provides clear pattern to follow

### Challenges Encountered
- **Scope balancing**: expand-stage needs full agent integration but most stages are simple
  - Resolution: Lower complexity thresholds, make agent research opt-in for complex cases
- **Three-way metadata**: collapse-stage updating three files is complex
  - Resolution: Atomic operations with rollback, comprehensive validation, thorough testing plan
- **Performance concerns**: Agent integration adds overhead
  - Resolution: Fast complexity detection, agents only for complex cases, benchmarks to track

### Recommendations for Future
- **Test with real plans**: Use Plan 028 or Plan 030 for integration testing
- **Migration script**: If metadata format changes, provide migration tool
- **Visualization**: Consider graphical view of plan structure (future enhancement)
- **Performance monitoring**: Track expand-stage performance to optimize if needed

## Notes

### Design Rationale

**Why Refactor Progressive Commands Now?**
- Plan 030 successfully demonstrated expand-phase pattern benefits
- Consistency across all progressive planning commands improves maintainability
- Agent integration elevates quality for complex stages
- Shared utilities reduce technical debt in collapse operations

**Why Agent Integration for expand-stage?**
- Stages can be complex (parallel implementations, integration testing)
- Research improves specification quality for complex cases
- Maintains consistency with expand-phase approach
- Flexibility: simple stages skip agents (most), complex stages benefit

**Why Extract Shared Utilities First?**
- Avoids code duplication (collapse commands share 80% logic)
- Provides stable foundation before refactoring individual commands
- Enables testing utilities independently
- Future-proofs for additional progressive planning commands

### Implementation Recommendations

**For Phase 1** (Shared Utilities):
- Design as pure functions with clear contracts
- Comprehensive unit tests (≥90% coverage)
- Document expected inputs/outputs explicitly
- Consider versioning if backward compatibility needed

**For Phase 4** (expand-stage Agent Integration):
- Test complexity detection with diverse stage examples
- Verify agent research adds value (quality improvement)
- Measure performance impact (should be <4 min for complex)
- Provide clear guidance on when to use agents vs direct

**For Phase 5** (Testing):
- Priority: Three-way metadata synchronization (collapse-stage)
- Test full workflow end-to-end (L0→L1→L2→L1→L0)
- Validate with existing progressive plans (backward compatibility)
- Performance benchmarks to catch regressions
