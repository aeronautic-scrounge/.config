## Phase 2 Detailed Progress

### Completed Transformations

#### Step 1: "Identify Research Topics" (Lines 87-106)
**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Converted passive "I'll analyze" to active "ANALYZE"
- ✅ Added EXECUTE NOW block with 4 numbered steps
- ✅ Added Topic Categories guidance section
- ✅ Added Complexity-Based Research Strategy examples
- ✅ Removed passive voice throughout

**Before**:
```markdown
I'll analyze the workflow description to extract 2-4 focused research topics:
```

**After**:
```markdown
ANALYZE the workflow description to extract 2-4 focused research topics.

**EXECUTE NOW**:
1. READ the user's workflow description
2. IDENTIFY key areas requiring investigation
3. EXTRACT 2-4 specific topics
4. GENERATE topic titles for each research area
```

#### Step 1.5: "Determine Thinking Mode" (Lines 133-175)
**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Converted to CALCULATE imperative command
- ✅ Added explicit 4-step EXECUTE NOW block
- ✅ Added complexity scoring algorithm with concrete formula
- ✅ Added 3 worked examples showing calculations
- ✅ Emphasized thinking mode applies to ALL agents

**Before**:
```markdown
Analyze workflow complexity to set appropriate thinking mode for agents:
```

**After**:
```markdown
CALCULATE workflow complexity score to determine thinking mode for all agents in this workflow.

**EXECUTE NOW**:
1. ANALYZE workflow description for complexity indicators
2. CALCULATE complexity score using this algorithm:
   [explicit formula with multiplication operators]
3. MAP complexity score to thinking mode
4. STORE thinking_mode in workflow_state
```

**Examples Added**:
1. "Add hello world function" → Score 2 (Simple)
2. "Implement user authentication system" → Score 9 (Complex, "think hard")
3. "Refactor core security module with breaking changes" → Score 23 (Critical, "think harder")

#### Step 2: "Launch Parallel Research Agents" (Lines 177-212)
**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directive
- ✅ Removed external command-patterns.md reference
- ✅ Inlined Task tool invocation structure with JSON
- ✅ Emphasized **CRITICAL**: SINGLE MESSAGE requirement
- ✅ Added concrete parallel invocation example
- ✅ Added monitoring instructions with PROGRESS markers

**Before**:
```markdown
For each identified research topic, I'll create a focused research task and invoke agents in parallel.

See [Parallel Agent Invocation](../docs/command-patterns.md) for detailed patterns.
```

**After**:
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke research-specialist agents in parallel.

For EACH research topic identified in Step 1:

INVOKE a research-specialist agent using the Task tool with these exact parameters:

```json
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Research [TOPIC_NAME] using research-specialist protocol",
  "prompt": "Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:\n/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md\n\nYou are acting as a Research Specialist Agent with the tools and constraints defined in that file.\n\n[COMPLETE PROMPT FROM STEP 3 - SEE BELOW]"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Send ALL research Task invocations in a SINGLE MESSAGE.
```

### Next Steps

#### Step 3: "Research Agent Prompt Template" (NEXT)
**Target**: Lines 214+
**Estimated Effort**: High (150+ lines to inline)

**Requirements**:
- Remove external reference to command-patterns.md
- Inline COMPLETE 150+ line research-specialist prompt template
- Add explicit placeholder substitution instructions
- Include all 4 topic type variations (existing_patterns, best_practices, alternatives, constraints)
- Show concrete report structure example
- Specify exact expected output format

**Placeholders to define**:
- [THINKING_MODE]
- [TOPIC_TITLE]
- [USER_WORKFLOW]
- [PROJECT_NAME]
- [TOPIC_SLUG]
- [SPECS_DIR]
- [COMPLEXITY_LEVEL]
- [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]

#### Remaining Steps (4-9)
- **Step 4**: Generate Project Name and Topic Slugs (Step 3.5)
- **Step 5**: Monitor Research Agent Execution (Step 3a - new)
- **Step 6**: Collect Report Paths from Agent Output (Step 4)
- **Step 7**: Save Research Checkpoint (Step 5)
- **Step 8**: Research Phase Execution Verification (Step 6)
- **Step 9**: Complete Research Phase Execution Example (Step 7)

   - Lines 87-106: Step 1 transformation
   - Lines 133-175: Step 1.5 transformation
   - Lines 177-212: Step 2 transformation
   - Total changes: 3 sections, ~70 lines transformed

## Transformation Patterns Applied

### Pattern 1: Passive → Active Voice
- "I'll analyze" → "ANALYZE"
- "I'll create" → "CREATE"
- "I'll invoke" → "INVOKE"
- "Analyze workflow" → "CALCULATE workflow complexity"

### Pattern 2: Documentation → Execution
- Added EXECUTE NOW blocks after every step
- Converted descriptions to numbered imperative steps
- Added explicit tool invocation instructions

### Pattern 3: Reference → Inline
- Removed: `See [Parallel Agent Invocation](../docs/command-patterns.md)`
- Added: Inline Task tool JSON structure with parameters

### Pattern 4: Example → Concrete Instruction
- Added worked examples showing actual calculations
- Added concrete parallel invocation syntax
- Specified exact output formats and markers

## Success Metrics

### Completed Success Criteria
- ✅ Passive voice conversion - 33% complete (Research Phase Steps 1, 1.5, 2)
- ✅ EXECUTE NOW blocks - Partial (3 steps complete)
- ✅ Task tool syntax inlined - Partial (Step 2 has inline JSON)

### Pending Success Criteria
- ⬜ Execution checklists - Pending (Step 6 verification checklist)
- ⬜ Research phase agent invocation - In Progress (33%)
- ⬜ Planning phase agent invocation - Pending (Phase 3)
- ⬜ Implementation phase agent invocation - Pending (Phase 4)
- ⬜ Debugging loop agent invocation - Pending (Phase 5)
- ⬜ Documentation phase agent invocation - Pending (Phase 6)
- ⬜ End-to-end test workflow - Pending (Phase 8)

## Estimated Remaining Effort

### Phase 2 Remaining
- Step 3 (Prompt Template Inline): 2-3 hours (large template)
- Steps 4-9 (Project Name, Monitoring, Collection, Checkpoint, Validation, Example): 3-4 hours
- **Total Phase 2 Remaining**: 5-7 hours

### Phases 3-8
- Phase 3 (Planning): 4-5 hours
- Phase 4 (Implementation): 6-8 hours
- Phase 5 (Debugging Loop): 6-8 hours
- Phase 6 (Documentation): 4-5 hours
- Phase 7 (Infrastructure): 3-4 hours
- Phase 8 (Testing): 8-10 hours
- **Total Phases 3-8**: 31-40 hours

**Overall Remaining**: 36-47 hours

## Notes

### What's Working Well
- Clear transformation patterns emerging (passive → active, reference → inline)
- EXECUTE NOW blocks provide clear structure
- Worked examples make instructions concrete
- Inline Task tool JSON removes ambiguity

### Challenges Identified
- Large inline templates (150+ lines for Step 3)
- Maintaining consistency across all transformations
- Balancing completeness with readability
- Ensuring all external references are eliminated

### Key Learnings
1. **Imperative Language Critical**: Every instruction must be a command, not a description
2. **Inline Better Than Reference**: External references create ambiguity
3. **Examples Drive Understanding**: Worked examples show exactly what to do
4. **Verification Prevents Skipping**: Checklists ensure execution actually happens

## Next Session Recommendations

### Immediate Priority
Continue with Step 3 (Research Agent Prompt Template inline):
1. Read the complete prompt template from phase_2_research_phase_refactor.md (lines 267-430)
2. Transform Step 3 section in orchestrate.md (lines 214+)
3. Inline the entire 150+ line template with all placeholders defined
4. Test the transformation for completeness

### Medium Priority
After Step 3 completion:
1. Complete Steps 4-9 to finish Phase 2
2. Test Phase 2 transformations with actual /orchestrate invocation
3. Verify agent invocation actually happens (not just documented)

### Long-term Priority
1. Apply Phase 2 patterns to Phases 3-6
2. Implement execution infrastructure (Phase 7)
3. Comprehensive integration testing (Phase 8)

## Git Status
- Modified files not yet committed
- Awaiting Phase 2 completion before creating commit
- Backup of original orchestrate.md exists
