# /orchestrate Command Completion Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: Complete functional implementation of /orchestrate command
- **Scope**: Transform the current template/documentation system into a working multi-agent workflow orchestrator
- **Estimated Phases**: 4
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/ORCHESTRATE_COMMAND_GUIDE.md
- **Related Plans**: 002_orchestrate_command.md (previous incomplete attempt)

## Overview

The current `/orchestrate` command is essentially a documentation template that shows what orchestration could look like but doesn't actually execute any workflows. Based on the findings in `ORCHESTRATE_COMMAND_GUIDE.md`, we need to implement a functional orchestration system that can:

1. Parse workflow descriptions into actionable steps
2. Automatically execute dependent commands in sequence (/report → /plan → /implement → /test-all)
3. Handle error recovery and resumption
4. Provide real-time progress monitoring
5. Manage command dependencies and resource allocation

This implementation will transform `/orchestrate` from a theoretical template into a practical automation tool that significantly improves development workflow efficiency.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Command parses workflow descriptions into executable command sequences
- [ ] Automatically executes /report, /plan, /implement, /test-all in intelligent order
- [ ] Handles command failures with retry and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Provides progress monitoring and status reporting
- [ ] Supports dry-run mode for workflow preview
- [ ] Maintains command context and parameter passing between phases
- [ ] Integrates with existing Claude Code slash command system
- [ ] Updates documentation to reflect new functional capabilities

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
```
/orchestrate "description" [options]
    ↓
Workflow Parser
    ↓
Command Sequencer → [/report] → [/plan] → [/implement] → [/test-all]
    ↓
Progress Monitor ← Error Handler ← Command Executor
    ↓
Results Aggregator
```

### Core Components
1. **Workflow Parser**: Analyzes input description and determines appropriate command sequence
2. **Command Sequencer**: Manages execution order and parameter passing
3. **Command Executor**: Invokes slash commands via SlashCommand tool
4. **Progress Monitor**: Tracks execution status and provides user feedback
5. **Error Handler**: Manages failures, retries, and recovery options
6. **Results Aggregator**: Collects outputs and generates final summary

### Command Interface
```bash
/orchestrate "<workflow-description>" [--dry-run] [--priority=<level>] [--template=<name>]
```

### Parameter Processing
- Parse workflow description to identify project type, scope, and complexity
- Determine which commands are needed in the sequence
- Extract key parameters for command execution
- Handle optional flags (dry-run, priority, template)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Orchestration Framework [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Create the basic workflow execution engine
**Complexity**: Medium

Tasks:
- [x] Create orchestration engine module in `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`
- [x] Implement workflow description parser that identifies command sequences
- [x] Build command executor that can invoke slash commands via SlashCommand tool
- [x] Add basic error handling and status reporting
- [x] Create dry-run mode that shows planned execution without running commands
- [x] Implement parameter extraction and passing between commands

Testing:
```bash
# Test basic orchestration
/orchestrate "add a simple configuration file" --dry-run

# Verify command sequence planning
/orchestrate "refactor user authentication module" --dry-run
```

Expected: Displays planned command sequence without execution

### Phase 2: Command Integration and Sequencing [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Implement intelligent command sequencing with proper parameter passing
**Complexity**: High

Tasks:
- [x] Build command dependency resolver that determines execution order
- [x] Implement parameter extraction from workflow descriptions
- [x] Create context preservation between command executions
- [x] Add support for skipping phases when not needed (e.g., skip /report if obvious)
- [x] Implement file path tracking and parameter passing between commands
- [x] Add command output collection and aggregation

Testing:
```bash
# Test actual orchestration execution
/orchestrate "add dark mode support to the application"

# Verify parameter passing
/orchestrate "fix authentication bug in user login"
```

Expected:
- Executes /report with extracted topic
- Passes report path to /plan
- Passes plan path to /implement
- Runs /test-all after implementation

### Phase 3: Progress Monitoring and Error Recovery
**Objective**: Add robust monitoring, error handling, and recovery mechanisms
**Complexity**: Medium

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement real-time progress reporting during command execution
- [ ] Add error detection and classification (temporary vs permanent failures)
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms for recoverable failures
- [ ] Implement workflow state persistence for resumption after interruption
- [ ] Add user interaction prompts for manual intervention when needed
- [ ] Create detailed execution logs and summaries

Testing:
```bash
# Test error recovery
/orchestrate "implement feature that requires missing dependency"

# Test interruption and resumption
# Start orchestration, interrupt with Ctrl+C, then test resumption
```

Expected:
- Graceful error handling with clear user feedback
- Ability to resume interrupted workflows
- Detailed progress and status information

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Documentation
**Objective**: Complete advanced features and update all documentation
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement template support for common workflow patterns
- [ ] Add priority handling that affects command execution parameters
- [ ] Create workflow analytics and performance tracking
- [ ] Implement intelligent command selection based on project context
- [ ] Add validation of completed workflows
- [ ] Update ORCHESTRATE_COMMAND_GUIDE.md with new functional capabilities
- [ ] Create usage examples and best practices documentation
- [ ] Add command to existing help system and which-key integration

Testing:
```bash
# Test complete workflow end-to-end
/orchestrate "create a new user dashboard with data visualization"

# Test template usage
/orchestrate "add API endpoint for user management" --template=api

# Test priority handling
/orchestrate "critical security fix for authentication" --priority=high
```

Expected:
- Complete automated workflow execution
- Proper template application
- Priority-based parameter adjustment

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test workflow description parsing with various input formats
- Verify command sequence generation for different project types
- Test parameter extraction and validation
- Verify error handling for various failure scenarios

## Notes

This implementation transforms `/orchestrate` from a theoretical documentation system into a practical development automation tool. The phased approach ensures we build reliable foundations before adding advanced features, and the comprehensive testing strategy ensures robustness across various use cases.

The key insight from the guide document is that users expect `/orchestrate` to actually orchestrate workflows, not just document them. This implementation delivers on that expectation while maintaining compatibility with the existing command ecosystem.
