## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: Practical /orchestrate command that actually works within Claude Code constraints
- **Scope**: Replace current documentation-only implementation with a working orchestration system
- **Estimated Phases**: 3
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**:
  - /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/reports/003_orchestrate_command_research.md
  - /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/reports/006_orchestrate_command_implementation_challenges.md
- **Previous Plans**: 002, 005, 006 (analyzed for lessons learned)

## Overview

After extensive analysis of previous implementation attempts, the existing sophisticated command ecosystem, and the core technical limitations of Claude Code's template system, this plan provides a practical solution that works within existing constraints while delivering real orchestration value.

**Core Insight**: The existing `/orchestrate` command already has sophisticated workflow analysis capabilities and access to SlashCommand tool, but it stops at documentation instead of execution. We need to transform it from a documentation generator into an actual workflow executor.

**Key Discovery**: The codebase already contains a sophisticated helper command infrastructure (`/coordination-hub`, `/workflow-status`, `/resource-manager`, etc.) that was designed for orchestration but is not being used by the current `/orchestrate` implementation.

**Key Innovation**: Complete the `/orchestrate` implementation by:
1. Using the existing workflow analysis to determine command sequences
2. Actually executing those commands via SlashCommand tool
3. Integrating with the existing helper command infrastructure
4. Following the proven patterns from `/implement` command for real execution

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Command actually executes other commands instead of just documenting them
- [ ] Intelligent workflow analysis determines appropriate command sequence
- [ ] Integration with existing helper command infrastructure (`/coordination-hub`, `/workflow-status`, etc.)
- [ ] Proper parameter extraction and passing between commands
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms following `/implement` patterns
- [ ] Progress tracking using TodoWrite and existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Real-time status updates via `/workflow-status` integration
- [ ] Integration with existing specs/ directory structure
- [ ] Backward compatibility with current usage patterns
- [ ] Auto-resume capabilities similar to `/implement` command

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview

```
User: /orchestrate "add dark mode to app"
         ↓
   Requirements Parser (existing analysis capabilities)
         ↓
   Workflow Analyzer → Determines: research needed? complexity? action type?
         ↓
   Coordination Setup → /coordination-hub create workflow
         ↓
   Command Sequencer → Plans: /report → /plan → /implement → /test-all
         ↓
   Execution Engine → Executes: SlashCommand("/report ...", "/plan ...", etc.)

Implementation Approach:
```markdown
# Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

I'll coordinate a complete workflow using the existing orchestration infrastructure.

## Creating Workflow: "{{ARGS}}"

**Setting up orchestration infrastructure...**
Creating workflow via /coordination-hub...
Initializing monitoring via /workflow-status...
Configuring resources via /resource-manager...

**Workflow Analysis:**
- Complexity: [determined by existing analysis]
- Action Type: [determined by existing analysis]

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Parameter Extraction Complexity
**Risk**: Complex workflows may have parameters that are difficult to extract accurately
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple pattern matching and evolve
- Provide clear feedback when parameter extraction is uncertain
- Allow user confirmation before proceeding with execution

#### 2. Command Sequence Logic
**Risk**: Determining the correct command sequence may be error-prone
**Mitigation**:
- Use conservative sequencing that works for most cases
- Provide dry-run mode for sequence validation
- Learn from user feedback and common patterns

#### 3. Error Propagation
**Risk**: Errors in one phase may cascade and break the entire workflow
**Mitigation**:
- Implement graceful error handling with clear user guidance
- Provide recovery options at each phase
- Allow manual intervention when automated recovery fails

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 1. Performance
**Risk**: Executing multiple commands in sequence may be slow
**Mitigation**:
- Optimize command execution and parameter passing
- Provide progress feedback to user
- Allow interruption and resumption if needed

#### 2. User Experience
**Risk**: Users may find orchestration behavior unpredictable
**Mitigation**:
- Provide clear feedback about decisions being made
- Offer dry-run mode for workflow preview
- Document common patterns and best practices

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: Successfully executes complete workflows for common development tasks
2. **Accuracy**: Correct command sequence and parameter extraction >90% of the time
3. **User Adoption**: Users prefer orchestration over manual command sequences
4. **Error Rate**: <10% of workflows require manual intervention
5. **Time Savings**: Average 50% reduction in time for multi-phase workflows

## Lessons Learned from Previous Attempts

### What Didn't Work
- **Template-based execution**: Cannot execute commands from within markdown templates
- **Documentation-only approach**: Users expect actual execution, not just analysis
- **Ignoring existing infrastructure**: Previous plans tried to build new systems instead of using existing ones

### What This Plan Does Differently
- **Leverage existing infrastructure**: Use the already-implemented helper command ecosystem
- **Direct SlashCommand execution**: Use the tool properly to actually invoke commands
- **Follow proven patterns**: Use `/implement` command patterns for execution and error handling
- **Integration over innovation**: Connect existing pieces rather than building new ones

### Key Insights from Command Review
- **Sophisticated ecosystem already exists**: 27 commands with complex interdependencies
- **Helper commands are production-ready**: `/coordination-hub`, `/workflow-status`, etc. are fully implemented
- **Proven execution patterns**: `/implement` shows exactly how to execute commands with error handling
- **SlashCommand tool works**: Other commands successfully use it for coordination
- **The gap is integration, not capability**: All pieces exist, they just need to be connected

## Implementation Priority

This plan should be **immediately implementable** because:
1. **Infrastructure Already Exists**: All necessary helper commands are implemented and ready
2. **Proven Patterns Available**: `/implement` command shows exactly how to do execution
3. **Tools Available**: SlashCommand, TodoWrite, and all required tools are working
4. **User Need**: Addresses the core user expectation of actual workflow automation
5. **High Impact**: Transforms 27-command ecosystem from individual tools to coordinated platform

## Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Pragmatic over Perfect**: Working solution over theoretical ideal
- **User-Centric**: Focus on user needs rather than architectural purity
- **Evolutionary**: Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary
- **Constraint-Aware**: Work with the platform, not against it

### Success Definition
Success means users can type `/orchestrate "add feature X"` and have it automatically execute `/report → /plan → /implement → /test-all` with appropriate parameters, handling errors gracefully, and providing useful feedback throughout the process.

This is the orchestration that users actually want and expect.
