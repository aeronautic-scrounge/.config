# Orchestrate Command Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: Complete refactoring of `/orchestrate` command to make it functional and meet industry best practices
- **Scope**: Replace non-functional placeholder with working workflow orchestration that actually executes commands
- **Estimated Phases**: 5
- **Standards File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md`
- **Research Reports**:
  - `.claude/specs/reports/008_orchestrate_command_refactoring_analysis.md`
  - `nvim/specs/reports/020_command_workflow_improvement_analysis.md`

## Overview

The `/orchestrate` command is currently completely non-functional - it contains 97 lines of repetitive analysis text that describes what it should do, but never actually executes any commands. This refactoring will transform it from a broken placeholder into a working workflow orchestration tool that properly uses the `SlashCommand` tool to invoke `/report`, `/plan`, `/implement`, and other dependent commands.

### Current Problems
1. Never invokes SlashCommand tool despite having permission
2. Doesn't parse arguments or extract flags (--dry-run, --template, --priority)
3. Contains infinite analysis loop with no actual logic
4. Ignores existing orchestration infrastructure (/coordination-hub, /workflow-template)
5. No error handling or recovery mechanisms

### Goals
1. Actually execute workflows by invoking dependent commands
2. Parse arguments and respect flags
3. Provide clear, actionable progress updates
4. Handle errors gracefully with recovery options
5. Integrate with existing orchestration infrastructure

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Command parses arguments and extracts flags correctly
- [ ] Command invokes `/report` when research is needed
- [ ] Command invokes `/plan` with correct parameters
- [ ] Command invokes `/implement` when not in dry-run mode
- [ ] `--dry-run` flag prevents execution beyond planning
- [ ] `--priority` flag is used for workflow prioritization
- [ ] `--template` flag integrates with workflow-template system
- [ ] Errors are detected and handled with user options
- [ ] Progress is visible via TodoWrite task list
- [ ] Command completes full workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Code is clear, concise, and maintainable (< 250 lines)
- [ ] No repetitive or redundant text

## Technical Design

### Architecture

```
User Input: /orchestrate <description> [flags]
    |
    v
[Argument Parsing] --> Extract description, --dry-run, --template, --priority
    |
    v
[Workflow Analysis] --> Determine: research needed, complexity, action type
    |
    v
[Progress Tracking] --> TodoWrite: create task list
    |
    v
[Workflow Execution] --> Sequential command invocation:
    |                    - /report (conditional)
    |                    - /plan
    |                    - /implement (if not dry-run)
    |                    - /test-all (if not dry-run)
    |                    - /document (if not dry-run)
    |
    v
[Progress Updates] --> TodoWrite: mark tasks complete
    |
    v
[Summary & Completion] --> Display results, next steps
```

### Command Flow

1. **Parse Phase**: Extract workflow description and flags using bash
2. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze description for keywords to determine workflow type
3. **Setup Phase**: Create progress tracking with TodoWrite
4. **Execution Phase**: Invoke commands sequentially using SlashCommand tool
5. **Monitoring Phase**: Update progress after each command completes
6. **Completion Phase**: Summarize results and provide next steps

### Key Components

**Argument Parser** (bash script):
- Separates description from flags
- Extracts --dry-run, --template, --priority
- Validates input

**Workflow Analyzer** (pattern matching):
- Detects research keywords: "new", "unfamiliar", "best practices", "architecture"
- Assesses complexity: "simple" vs "system" vs "architecture"
- Identifies action type: "create", "fix", "refactor", "update"

**Command Orchestrator** (SlashCommand invocations):
- Conditionally invokes /report
- Always invokes /plan
- Conditionally invokes /implement, /test-all, /document
- Passes correct arguments between commands

**Progress Tracker** (TodoWrite):
- Creates task list at start
- Updates as each phase completes
- Provides visual progress indication

**Error Handler**:
- Detects command failures
- Presents options (retry, skip, abort)
- Saves workflow state for resume

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Strip Out Non-Functional Code [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Remove all placeholder text and create clean foundation
**Complexity**: Low

Tasks:
- [x] Back up current `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`
- [x] Remove all repetitive analysis sections (lines 8-97)
- [x] Keep only frontmatter (lines 1-7)
- [x] Add simple header: "Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration"
- [x] Add placeholder for argument parsing section
- [x] Add placeholder for workflow execution section
- [x] Verify frontmatter is intact with correct tools

Testing:
```bash
# Verify file syntax
cat .claude/commands/orchestrate.md

# Check frontmatter is valid YAML
head -n 7 .claude/commands/orchestrate.md
```

Expected outcome:
- File is ~50 lines (down from 97)
- No repetitive text remains
- Frontmatter is preserved
- Clear sections are defined

### Phase 2: Implement Argument Parsing [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Parse workflow description and extract flags
**Complexity**: Medium

Tasks:
- [x] Add bash script to parse $ARGUMENTS in `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:15`
- [x] Extract workflow description (everything not starting with --)
- [x] Extract --dry-run flag (boolean)
- [x] Extract --template=<name> parameter
- [x] Extract --priority=<level> parameter
- [x] Display parsed arguments for user confirmation
- [x] Add error handling for invalid flags
- [x] Test with various argument combinations

Testing:
```bash
# Test various argument patterns
/orchestrate implement auth system
# Expected: workflow="implement auth system", dry_run=false, priority="medium"

/orchestrate implement auth --dry-run --priority=high
# Expected: workflow="implement auth", dry_run=true, priority="high"

/orchestrate deploy app --template=microservice --priority=low
# Expected: workflow="deploy app", template="microservice", priority="low"
```

Expected outcome:
- Arguments are correctly separated
- Flags are properly extracted
- Default values are applied (priority=medium, dry_run=false)
- Invalid flags are detected

### Phase 3: Implement Workflow Analysis [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Analyze description to determine workflow type and phases needed
**Complexity**: Medium

Tasks:
- [x] Add keyword detection logic in `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:40`
- [x] Detect research keywords: grep for "new", "unfamiliar", "understand", "best practices", "architecture"
- [x] Assess complexity: check for "simple"/"quick" (low) vs "system"/"architecture" (high)
- [x] Identify action type: "implement"/"create" vs "fix"/"debug" vs "refactor"/"improve"
- [x] Determine required phases based on analysis
- [x] Display analysis results to user
- [x] Add logic to skip unnecessary phases

Testing:
```bash
# Test research detection
/orchestrate research new AI framework
# Expected: research_needed=true, complexity=high

# Test simple fix
/orchestrate fix typo in config file
# Expected: research_needed=false, complexity=low

# Test system implementation
/orchestrate implement complete authentication architecture
# Expected: research_needed=true, complexity=high
```

Expected outcome:
- Keywords are correctly detected
- Complexity is accurately assessed
- Action type is properly identified
- Phase requirements are determined

### Phase 4: Implement Core Workflow Execution [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Actually invoke dependent commands using SlashCommand tool
**Complexity**: High

Tasks:
- [x] Add TodoWrite task list creation in `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:70`
- [x] Implement conditional /report invocation (if research_needed=true)
- [x] Use SlashCommand tool to invoke: /report <workflow_description> best practices and implementation
- [x] Capture report path from /report output
- [x] Implement /plan invocation with report path (if available)
- [x] Use SlashCommand tool to invoke: /plan <workflow_description> [report_path]
- [x] Capture plan path from /plan output
- [x] Implement conditional /implement invocation (if dry_run=false)
- [x] Use SlashCommand tool to invoke: /implement [plan_path]
- [x] Implement conditional /test-all invocation (if dry_run=false)
- [x] Use SlashCommand tool to invoke: /test-all
- [x] Implement conditional /document invocation (if dry_run=false)
- [x] Use SlashCommand tool to invoke: /document
- [x] Update TodoWrite task list after each command completes
- [x] Add command execution logging

Testing:
```bash
# Test full workflow
/orchestrate implement user authentication system
# Expected: /report → /plan → /implement → /test-all → /document all execute

# Test dry-run
/orchestrate implement feature --dry-run
# Expected: /report → /plan only, implementation skipped

# Test simple workflow (no research)
/orchestrate fix minor bug in auth
# Expected: /plan → /implement → /test-all only
```

Expected outcome:
- Commands are actually invoked via SlashCommand tool
- Report/plan paths are correctly passed between commands
- Dry-run prevents implementation/testing/documentation
- Progress updates appear after each command
- Full workflows complete end-to-end

### Phase 5: Add Error Handling and Recovery [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Handle command failures gracefully with recovery options
**Complexity**: Medium

Tasks:
- [x] Add try-catch pattern around each SlashCommand invocation
- [x] Detect command execution failures
- [x] Save workflow state on error in `.claude/orchestration/workflow_state.json`
- [x] Present user with recovery options (retry, skip, abort)
- [x] Implement retry logic for failed commands
- [x] Implement skip logic to continue workflow
- [x] Implement abort logic to stop gracefully
- [x] Add workflow resume capability
- [x] Log all errors to `.claude/orchestration/workflow_errors.log`
- [x] Test various failure scenarios

Testing:
```bash
# Test plan failure handling
/orchestrate [invalid workflow description that causes plan to fail]
# Expected: Error detected, options presented (retry/skip/abort)

# Test resume capability
# 1. Start workflow that fails mid-way
# 2. Fix the issue
# 3. Resume from saved state
# Expected: Workflow continues from where it stopped
```

Expected outcome:
- Failures are detected and reported clearly
- Users can choose how to proceed (retry/skip/abort)
- Workflow state is saved for resume
- Errors are logged for debugging
- Graceful degradation on failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Test each component in isolation:

1. **Argument Parsing**:
   - Test with description only
   - Test with each flag individually
   - Test with multiple flags
   - Test with invalid flags

2. **Workflow Analysis**:
   - Test research keyword detection
   - Test complexity assessment
   - Test action type identification
   - Test with edge cases

3. **Command Invocation**:
   - Test /report invocation
   - Test /plan invocation with and without report
   - Test /implement invocation
   - Test conditional execution

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflows:

1. **Full Research → Implement Workflow**:
   ```bash
   /orchestrate implement comprehensive authentication system with JWT
   # Expected: /report → /plan → /implement → /test-all → /document
   ```

2. **Simple Bugfix Workflow**:
   ```bash
   /orchestrate fix typo in login validation
   # Expected: /plan → /implement → /test-all
   ```

3. **Dry-Run Workflow**:
   ```bash
   /orchestrate implement new feature --dry-run
   # Expected: /report → /plan only
   ```

4. **High-Priority Workflow**:
   ```bash
   /orchestrate urgent security fix --priority=high
   # Expected: Priority passed to coordination-hub if used
   ```

### Error Handling Tests

Test failure scenarios:

1. **Plan Creation Failure**:
   - Provide invalid workflow description
   - Verify error is detected
   - Verify options are presented
   - Test retry/skip/abort

2. **Implementation Failure**:
   - Start workflow that will fail during implementation
   - Verify state is saved
   - Verify resume works correctly

3. **Missing Dependent Command**:
   - Temporarily rename a dependent command
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - Restore command

### Performance Tests

Verify efficiency:

1. **Response Time**: Command should start execution within 2 seconds
2. **Progress Updates**: Should appear within 5 seconds of each command completion
3. **Memory Usage**: Should not spike during workflow execution

## Git Commit Strategy

Each phase will be committed separately:

**Phase 1 Commit**:
```
refactor: strip non-functional code from /orchestrate command

Remove 97 lines of repetitive analysis text that never executed.
Create clean foundation with proper structure for implementation.

Related to: .claude/specs/reports/008_orchestrate_command_refactoring_analysis.md
```

**Phase 2 Commit**:
```
feat: implement argument parsing for /orchestrate

Add bash-based argument parsing to extract workflow description
and flags (--dry-run, --template, --priority).

Tests confirm flags are correctly extracted and validated.
```

**Phase 3 Commit**:
```
feat: add workflow analysis to /orchestrate

Implement keyword detection and complexity assessment to determine
which workflow phases are needed.

Research detection, complexity assessment, and action type
identification all working correctly.
```

**Phase 4 Commit**:
```
feat: implement core workflow execution in /orchestrate

Add actual command invocations using SlashCommand tool.
Workflow now executes /report → /plan → /implement → /test-all → /document.

Full end-to-end workflows now functional.
```

**Phase 5 Commit**:
```
feat: add error handling and recovery to /orchestrate

Implement failure detection, state saving, and recovery options.
Users can retry, skip, or abort on errors.
Workflows can be resumed after failures.
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**Risk**: Breaking existing workflows that depend on current behavior
- **Mitigation**: Current command is non-functional, so no actual workflows depend on it
- **Impact**: Low - command doesn't work now, so can't break anything

**Risk**: SlashCommand invocations fail silently
- **Mitigation**: Add explicit error checking after each invocation
- **Impact**: Medium - could lead to incomplete workflows

### Medium Risks

**Risk**: Argument parsing fails on edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with various argument patterns
- **Impact**: Medium - could prevent command usage

**Risk**: Workflow state corruption
- **Mitigation**: Validate state before saving, use JSON format
- **Impact**: Medium - could prevent resume capability

### Low Risks

**Risk**: Progress updates are too verbose
- **Mitigation**: Make TodoWrite updates concise and clear
- **Impact**: Low - minor UX issue

**Risk**: Performance degradation on long workflows
- **Mitigation**: Monitor execution time, optimize if needed
- **Impact**: Low - orchestration inherently takes time

## Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Sequential vs Parallel Execution**: Starting with sequential execution for simplicity. Parallel execution can be added in future phases using `/coordination-hub`.

2. **Error Handling Philosophy**: Fail gracefully with clear options rather than silent failures. Users should always know what went wrong and how to proceed.

3. **Progress Tracking**: Using TodoWrite for now. Can integrate with `/workflow-status` in future for enterprise features.

4. **Template Integration**: Basic implementation in Phase 4-5, full integration with `/workflow-template` as future enhancement.

### Future Enhancements

After core functionality is complete, consider:

1. **Advanced Orchestration**: Integration with `/coordination-hub` for enterprise features (checkpointing, resource management, monitoring)

2. **Template System**: Full integration with `/workflow-template` for reusable workflow patterns

3. **Parallel Execution**: Use coordination-hub to execute independent phases in parallel

4. **Workflow Learning**: Track success patterns and optimize future workflows

5. **Custom Workflows**: Allow users to define custom command sequences

6. **Workflow Visualization**: Generate visual diagrams of workflow execution

### Reference Implementation

See research report for detailed code examples:
- `.claude/specs/reports/008_orchestrate_command_refactoring_analysis.md` (lines 300-600)

Key sections:
- Recommendation 1: Core Execution Logic (lines 300-400)
- Recommendation 4: Error Handling (lines 500-600)

### Breaking Changes

**None** - Current command is non-functional, so this is purely additive.

Users who were attempting to use `/orchestrate` will now get actual functionality instead of placeholder text.

### Performance Targets

- Command startup: < 2 seconds
- Argument parsing: < 1 second
- Workflow analysis: < 2 seconds
- Command invocation overhead: < 1 second per command
- Total overhead (non-command time): < 10 seconds for full workflow

The majority of time will be spent in the actual command execution (/report, /plan, /implement), which is expected and unavoidable.
