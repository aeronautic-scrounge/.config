## Revision History

### [2025-10-06] - Revision 1: Clean Breaks Over Backward Compatibility
**Changes**: Replaced backward compatibility approach with clean breaks
**Reason**: User preference for clean, cruft-free system over maintaining legacy command wrappers
**Modified Sections**:
- Command Consolidation Strategy: Changed from wrappers to clean removal
- Phase 2 tasks: Delete old commands instead of creating wrappers
- Success Criteria: Removed "zero breaking changes" requirement
- Technical Debt Prevention: Replaced backward compatibility with clean break strategy
- Testing Strategy: Changed from backward compatibility tests to migration validation tests
**User Approval**: Added explicit user approval requirement for `/analyze-agents` + `/analyze-patterns` removal
**Impact**: Cleaner system with clear migration path, no cruft from deprecated wrappers

### [2025-10-06] - Revision 2: Complete All Deferred Tasks
**Changes**: Un-deferred all tasks previously marked as "Future enhancement" or "Future optimization"
**Reason**: User preference to avoid accumulating technical debt by completing all work now
**Modified Sections**:
- Phase 4: Un-deferred adaptive planning logging and observability (line 456)
- Phase 4: Un-deferred adaptive planning integration tests (line 496)
- Phase 5: Un-deferred /revise auto-mode integration tests (line 598)
- Phase 6: Un-deferred command refactoring to use shared utilities (line 699)
**Impact**: All features fully implemented and tested, zero technical debt accumulated, cleaner codebase with shared utilities properly integrated

## Overview

This plan refines the agential system for lean efficiency while maintaining full functionality. The refinement addresses four key areas:

1. **Command Consolidation**: Merge 3-4 redundant commands into unified interfaces, reducing the command surface area by ~10-15% while preserving all functionality
2. **Agent Architecture Refactoring**: Extract duplicated logic (progress streaming, error handling) from 6+ agents, reducing codebase by ~15%
3. **Adaptive Planning Detection**: Add intelligent replanning triggers to /implement that detect complexity overruns, test failures, and scope drift
4. **Technical Debt Prevention**: Establish comprehensive test coverage (>80%) before any refactoring to ensure zero breaking changes

The approach is deliberately incremental and test-first: establish testing infrastructure before making changes, consolidate low-risk commands first, refactor agents to establish stable patterns, then integrate adaptive planning on a solid foundation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands consolidated without functionality loss (3-4 commands removed)
- [ ] Agent duplication removed (~200+ LOC reduction from progress streaming extraction)
- [ ] /implement has adaptive planning detection with 3 trigger types
- [ ] Adaptive planning has full logging and observability with log rotation
- [ ] Adaptive planning integration tests complete and passing
- [ ] /revise auto-mode integration tests complete and passing
- [ ] Commands refactored to use shared utilities (~200-300 LOC reduction)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80% for modified code)
- [ ] Clean breaks with user approval when necessary
- [ ] Documentation updated across all changes (commands, agents, CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Migration guide for any breaking changes
- [ ] System is lean, consistent, and cruft-free
- [ ] Zero technical debt accumulated (all deferred tasks completed)

## Technical Design

### Command Consolidation Strategy

**Principle**: Clean breaks over backward compatibility to avoid cruft.

**Consolidations** (Commands to Remove):
1. `/cleanup` → Remove entirely, use `/setup --cleanup`
   - Rationale: Cleanup is a setup operation, separate command adds unnecessary surface area
   - Migration: Direct replacement, no wrapper
   - User Impact: Low (simple command substitution)

2. `/validate-setup` → Remove entirely, use `/setup --validate`
   - Rationale: Validation is part of setup verification, no need for separate command
   - Migration: Direct replacement, no wrapper
   - User Impact: Low (simple command substitution)

3. `/analyze-agents` + `/analyze-patterns` → Remove both, use `/analyze [type]`
   - Rationale: Unified analysis interface is cleaner than two commands
   - Migration: Direct replacement with type parameter
   - Types: `agents`, `patterns`, `all` (default)
   - User Impact: Medium (requires adding type parameter)
   - **User Approval Required**: Ask if clean break is acceptable for analysis commands

4. Extract shared utilities from `/orchestrate`, `/setup`, `/implement`:
   - Checkpoint management → `lib/checkpoint-utils.sh`
   - Complexity analysis → `lib/complexity-utils.sh`
   - Artifact registry → `lib/artifact-utils.sh`
   - Error recovery → `lib/error-utils.sh`
   - User Impact: None (internal refactoring)

**Breaking Change Policy**:
- Commands 1-2: Clean removal, simple substitution (no approval needed)
- Command 3: Requires user approval due to syntax change
- If user declines: Implement temporary wrappers with deprecation warnings
- All breaking changes documented in migration guide

### Agent Refactoring Approach

**Problem**: 200+ lines of duplicated progress streaming across 6 agents

**Solution**: Extract to shared protocol documentation and reference it

**Approach**:
1. Create `agents/shared/progress-streaming-protocol.md` documenting:
   - Standard streaming format
   - Progress markers (STARTING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, ERROR)
   - Structured output conventions
   - Error reporting patterns

2. Create `agents/shared/error-handling-guidelines.md` documenting:
   - Retry patterns with exponential backoff
   - Error classification (recoverable vs fatal)
   - Fallback strategies
   - User notification standards

3. Simplify `code-writer.md`:
   - Remove unused REQUEST_AGENT collaboration protocol
   - Reference shared progress streaming protocol
   - Standardize with other agents

4. Standardize agent prompt structure:
   ```markdown
   # Agent Name

   ## Core Responsibility
   [Single clear purpose]

   ## Capabilities
   [Bullet list of what agent can do]

   ## Protocols
   - Progress Streaming: See agents/shared/progress-streaming-protocol.md
   - Error Handling: See agents/shared/error-handling-guidelines.md

   ## Specialization
   [Unique agent-specific logic]
   ```

**Benefits**: Reduces duplication, standardizes patterns, makes future agent creation easier.

### Adaptive Planning Integration

**Hook Point**: After Step 3.3 (error analysis) in /implement command

**Detection Triggers**:

1. **Excessive Task Complexity**
   - Condition: Phase complexity score >8 OR >10 tasks in single phase
   - Signal: Plan structure inadequate for actual complexity
   - Action: Suggest `/expand-phase <plan> <phase-num>`

2. **Multiple Test Failures**
   - Condition: 2+ consecutive test failures in same phase
   - Signal: Implementation approach needs rethinking
   - Action: Trigger `/revise --auto-mode` with failure analysis

3. **Missing Phases Discovered**
   - Condition: Implementation reveals work not in original plan
   - Signal: Scope drift or incomplete planning
   - Action: Trigger `/revise --auto-mode` to add phases

**Integration Flow**:
```
/implement execution
  ├─ Phase N execution
  ├─ Task completion
  ├─ Testing
  ├─ Error analysis (Step 3.3)
  │   ├─ Check complexity trigger
  │   ├─ Check failure pattern trigger
  │   └─ Check scope drift trigger
  ├─ [IF TRIGGERED] Invoke /revise --auto-mode
  │   ├─ Pass context: revision_type, current_phase, reason, suggested_action
  │   ├─ Receive: updated plan path, success status
  │   └─ Update checkpoint with replan metadata
  └─ Continue or retry with updated plan
```

**Loop Prevention**:
- Checkpoint fields: `replanning_count`, `last_replan_reason`, `replan_phase_N_count`
- Limit: Max 2 replanning attempts per phase
- Safeguard: If limit exceeded, escalate to user for manual intervention

**Context Passing**:
```json
{
  "revision_type": "add_phase|expand_phase|adjust_scope",
  "current_phase": 3,
  "reason": "Two consecutive test failures in authentication module",
  "suggested_action": "Add prerequisite phase for dependency setup",
  "test_failure_log": "...",
  "complexity_metrics": { "tasks": 12, "score": 9.2 }
}
```

### Testing Infrastructure

**Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage before any refactoring

**Test Categories**:

1. **Parsing Utilities** (`test_parsing_utilities.sh`)
   - 40+ functions in `parse-adaptive-plan.sh`
   - Unit tests for each parsing function
   - Edge cases: malformed plans, missing metadata, legacy formats

2. **Command Integration** (`test_command_integration.sh`)
   - End-to-end workflows: `/plan` → `/implement` → `/resume-implement`
   - Argument parsing for all commands
   - Hook execution sequences
   - Template rendering chains

3. **Round-Trip Tests** (`test_progressive_roundtrip.sh`)
   - Expand phase → collapse phase → verify identical
   - Expand stage → collapse stage → verify identical
   - Metadata preservation across all operations
   - Checksum validation of plan content

4. **State Management** (`test_state_management.sh`)
   - Checkpoint save/restore operations
   - Concurrent checkpoint handling
   - Checkpoint migration from old formats
   - Lock file management

5. **Agent Coordination** (`test_agent_coordination.sh`)
   - Agent invocation via registry
   - Parameter passing to agents
   - Agent response parsing
   - Error handling in agent calls

**Coverage Target**: ≥80% for all modified code, ≥60% baseline for existing code

**Test Framework**: Bash test scripts with assertion library, following existing patterns in `.claude/tests/`

- `migrate_legacy_plan_format()` - Convert old plan format to current
- Edge cases: Malformed metadata, missing sections, unicode characters

**Command Argument Parsing** (`.claude/tests/test_command_integration.sh`):
- Each command's argument validation
- Flag parsing (e.g., `--cleanup`, `--auto-mode`)
- Parameter combinations
- Error messages for invalid arguments

**Agent Prompt Generation** (`.claude/tests/test_agent_coordination.sh`):
- Agent registry lookup
- Parameter substitution in prompts
- Shared protocol reference resolution
- Agent response parsing

**Checkpoint Operations** (`.claude/tests/test_state_management.sh`):
- `save_checkpoint()` with all fields

**Shared Utilities** (`.claude/tests/test_shared_utilities.sh`):
- All functions in `lib/checkpoint-utils.sh`
- All functions in `lib/complexity-utils.sh`
- All functions in `lib/artifact-utils.sh`
- All functions in `lib/error-utils.sh`

### Integration Tests

**Multi-Command Workflows** (`.claude/tests/test_command_integration.sh`):
- `/plan` → plan file created with correct structure
- `/implement` → execution, checkpoints, commits
- `/resume-implement` → restores from checkpoint correctly
- `/expand-phase` → creates directory, preserves content
- `/collapse-phase` → merges directory, preserves metadata
- `/revise --auto-mode` → updates plan based on context

**Agent Coordination** (`.claude/tests/test_agent_coordination.sh`):
- Agent invocation via registry
- Parameter passing to agents
- Agent output capture and parsing
- Error handling in agent calls
- Multiple agent invocations in sequence

**Hook Execution** (`.claude/tests/test_hooks.sh`):
- Pre-phase hooks execute before phase starts
- Post-phase hooks execute after phase completes
- Hook failures handled gracefully
- Hook context passed correctly

**Template Rendering** (`.claude/tests/test_templates.sh`):
- Plan templates render with correct structure
- Variable substitution works correctly
- Conditional sections handled properly
- Output format matches expected structure

### Round-Trip Tests

**Expansion/Collapse Cycles** (`.claude/tests/test_progressive_roundtrip.sh`):
- **Phase Expansion Round-Trip**:
  1. Start with flat plan (Level 0)
  2. Expand phase N to directory (Level 1)
  3. Collapse phase N back to flat
  4. Verify content identical (checksum match)
  5. Verify metadata preserved (all fields intact)

- **Stage Expansion Round-Trip**:
  1. Start with phase directory (Level 1)
  2. Expand stage M to subdirectory (Level 2)
  3. Collapse stage M back to phase file
  4. Verify content identical
  5. Verify metadata preserved

- **Multi-Level Round-Trip**:
  1. Flat → expand phase → expand stage (Level 0 → 2)
  2. Collapse stage → collapse phase (Level 2 → 0)
  3. Verify original and final are identical

**Metadata Preservation** (`.claude/tests/test_progressive_roundtrip.sh`):
- All metadata fields preserved across transformations
- Checkpoint fields preserved in expansions
- Version history maintained
- Structure level tracking accurate

### Regression Tests

**Legacy Plan Structures** (`.claude/tests/test_regression.sh`):
- Pre-progressive plan formats still parse
- Old tier system metadata handled gracefully
- Legacy checkpoint formats migrate correctly
- Deprecated command wrappers still function

**Breaking Change Validation** (`.claude/tests/test_migration.sh`):
- Removed commands fail with helpful error messages
- Migration guide examples all work correctly

- Plan structure migrations preserve data

**Edge Cases** (`.claude/tests/test_regression.sh`):
- Empty phases (no tasks)
- Very large plans (>50 phases)
- Complex nesting (deep directory structures)
- Unicode and special characters in content
- Plans with missing optional metadata

### Adaptive Planning Tests

**Trigger Detection** (`.claude/tests/test_adaptive_planning.sh`):
- **Complexity Trigger**:
  - Create phase with >10 tasks → verify trigger fires
  - Create phase with complexity score >8 → verify trigger fires
  - Create phase below thresholds → verify no trigger

- **Test Failure Trigger**:
  - Simulate 2 consecutive test failures → verify trigger fires
  - Simulate 1 failure then success → verify no trigger
  - Simulate failures in different phases → verify no trigger

- **Scope Drift Trigger**:
  - Use `--report-scope-drift` flag → verify trigger fires
  - Mark tasks as "out of scope" → verify detection
  - Normal execution → verify no trigger

**Replanning Invocation** (`.claude/tests/test_adaptive_planning.sh`):
- Trigger fires → `/revise --auto-mode` invoked
- Context passed correctly (all fields present)
- Updated plan path returned and used
- Checkpoint updated with replan metadata

**Loop Prevention** (`.claude/tests/test_adaptive_planning.sh`):
- First replan in phase → allowed
- Second replan in phase → allowed
- Third replan attempt → blocked, user escalation
- Replan count resets per phase

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

**1. Refactoring parse-adaptive-plan.sh**
- **Risk**: Central parsing dependency affects all plan operations
- **Impact**: Could break all progressive plan features
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive unit tests for all 40+ functions (Phase 1)
  - Round-trip tests ensure no data loss
  - Test legacy format migration extensively
  - Maintain backward compatibility strictly
- **Rollback**: Git revert capability, comprehensive tests catch issues early

**2. Adaptive Planning Loop Risk**
- **Risk**: Poorly tuned triggers could cause infinite replanning loops
- **Impact**: /implement hangs or consumes excessive resources
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict iteration limits (max 2 replans per phase)
  - Comprehensive logging of all trigger evaluations
  - User escalation when limits exceeded
  - Testing includes loop scenarios
- **Rollback**: Can disable adaptive planning with flag if issues arise

### Medium Risk Items

**1. Checkpoint Schema Changes**
- **Risk**: New fields could break old checkpoint restoration
- **Impact**: Cannot resume existing implementations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Version field in all checkpoints
  - Migration functions for each version
  - Testing includes old checkpoint formats
  - Graceful degradation for unknown versions
- **Rollback**: Migration functions are reversible

**2. Agent Refactoring**
- **Risk**: Removing code from agents could break functionality
- **Impact**: Agent invocations fail or produce incorrect results
- **Mitigation**:
  - Agent coordination tests before and after refactoring
  - Manual testing of each agent through primary command
  - Shared protocols documented before removal
  - Incremental extraction with testing
- **Rollback**: Git revert per-agent changes independently

**3. Shared Utility Extraction**
- **Risk**: Commands might behave differently after extraction
- **Impact**: Subtle bugs in orchestrate, implement, setup
- **Mitigation**:
  - Integration tests validate commands before/after
  - Extensive manual testing of key workflows
  - Unit tests for all extracted functions
  - Careful review of function interfaces
- **Rollback**: Git revert per-utility library independently

### Low Risk Items

**1. Command Consolidation**
- **Risk**: Minimal, mostly documentation changes
- **Impact**: Deprecation warnings might annoy users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear deprecation messages with guidance
  - Wrappers maintain full functionality
  - Migration guide with examples
- **Rollback**: Simple to restore old command files

**2. Documentation Updates**
- **Risk**: Minimal, no code impact
- **Impact**: Outdated docs could confuse users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Concurrent updates with code changes
  - Link validation before completion
  - Examples tested before documenting
- **Rollback**: Git revert documentation changes

### Risk Monitoring

**During Implementation**:
- Run tests after every significant change
- Monitor test execution time (detect performance regressions)
- Check logs for unexpected warnings or errors
- Validate coverage metrics don't decrease
- Manual testing of critical workflows each phase

**Post-Implementation**:
- Monitor adaptive planning trigger rates (ensure not too frequent)
- Track replan success rates (ensure triggers are helpful)
- Collect user feedback on consolidated commands
- Monitor for regression reports
- Track test coverage trends over time

## Notes

### Phased Approach Rationale

The 8-phase structure follows a deliberate strategy:

1. **Phase 1 (Testing First)**: Prevents regressions by establishing safety net before changes
2. **Phase 2 (Low-Risk Consolidations)**: Builds confidence with simple, visible wins
3. **Phase 3 (Agent Refactoring)**: Establishes shared patterns before complex integration work
4. **Phase 5 (Auto-Mode First)**: Must complete before Phase 4 can integrate /revise
5. **Phase 4 (Adaptive Planning)**: Requires stable foundation from prior phases
6. **Phase 6 (Shared Utilities)**: Can happen anytime after Phase 1, placed here to reduce code before validation
7. **Phase 7 (Comprehensive Validation)**: Ensures all changes integrate correctly
8. **Phase 8 (Documentation)**: Final step ensures all changes documented

Phases 2, 3, 5, 6 have minimal dependencies and could be reordered if needed.

### Clean Break Strategy

**Command Removal Approach**:
- Remove commands cleanly (no wrappers or deprecation warnings)
- Removed commands fail immediately with clear error message
- Error message provides exact replacement command syntax
- Example: `/cleanup` fails with "Command removed. Use: /setup --cleanup"

**User Approval Process**:
- Simple substitutions (same functionality, different flag): No approval needed
- Syntax changes (parameter required): Ask user for approval
- If user declines breaking change: Implement temporary wrapper with warning
- Document user's preference for future decisions

**Migration Path**:
- Document all breaking changes in MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with before/after examples
- Checkpoint/plan format migrations: Automatic (data integrity critical)
- Provide migration script if complex changes needed
- Update all examples in documentation to use new syntax

**Version Detection**:
- All schemas include version field for data formats (checkpoints, plans)
- Automatic migration for data formats (no user action)
- Commands: Clean removal, no version checking needed

### Success Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- Command count: 29 → ~25-26 (10-15% reduction)
- Agent LOC: Reduce by ~200 lines (~15% reduction from progress streaming)
- Test coverage: From ~8% (2 test files) to >80% for modified code, >60% baseline
- Adaptive planning: Successful replan rate >90% when triggered

**Qualitative**:
- Clean, cruft-free command interface
- Clear migration path with helpful error messages
- Documentation comprehensive and accurate
- User feedback positive on adaptive planning and cleaner interface
- System feels more consistent and easier to learn

### Maintenance Considerations

**Ongoing Testing**:
- Test suite runs on every commit (CI/CD integration recommended)
- Coverage monitoring to prevent regression
- Periodic manual testing of key workflows
- Regression tests for each bug fix

**Future Enhancements**:
- Shared utilities foundation enables easier command development
- Shared agent protocols simplify adding new agents
- Adaptive planning foundation can expand to new trigger types
- Testing infrastructure supports confident refactoring

**Technical Debt Monitoring**:
- Track test coverage trends
- Monitor code duplication metrics
- Review deprecated command usage logs
- Plan eventual removal of deprecated features

### Implementation Timeline

**Estimated Total Duration**: 12-18 implementation sessions

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Testing): 2-3 sessions (foundational, worth the investment)
- Phase 2 (Consolidation): 1-2 sessions (straightforward)
- Phase 3 (Agents): 2 sessions (methodical extraction)
- Phase 4 (Adaptive Planning): 3-4 sessions (most complex)
- Phase 5 (/revise Auto-Mode): 1-2 sessions (focused feature)
- Phase 6 (Shared Utilities): 2-3 sessions (careful extraction)
- Phase 7 (Validation): 2 sessions (comprehensive testing)
- Phase 8 (Documentation): 1-2 sessions (writing and validation)

**Recommended Pace**: 2-3 phases per week, allowing time for testing and validation

### Key Technical Decisions

**1. Test-First Approach**: Comprehensive testing before refactoring prevents regressions and builds confidence

**2. Incremental Consolidation**: Merge commands through feature flags and wrappers, not deletion, preserves backward compatibility

**3. Shared Protocols over Shared Code**: Extract agent patterns to documentation (protocols) rather than executable code reduces coupling

**4. Adaptive Planning Limits**: Max 2 replans per phase prevents loops while allowing flexibility

**5. Auto-Mode for /revise**: Separate automated mode preserves interactive mode simplicity while enabling integration

**6. Progressive Utility Extraction**: Extract utilities to separate libraries rather than inline functions improves testability and reusability

**7. Metadata Versioning**: Version all schemas enables graceful migration and backward compatibility

**8. Coverage Gates**: Enforce ≥80% coverage for modified code ensures quality without burdening existing code
