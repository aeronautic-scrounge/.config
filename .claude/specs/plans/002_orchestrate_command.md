## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: /orchestrate - Multi-agent workflow orchestration command
- **Scope**: Create an orchestration command that coordinates complete research → planning → implementation workflows using multiple subagents
- **Estimated Phases**: 6
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.dotfiles/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**: /home/benjamin/.dotfiles/specs/reports/003_orchestrate_command_research.md
- **Related Plans**: /home/benjamin/.dotfiles/specs/plans/003_orchestrate_helper_commands.md

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated `/orchestrate` command that serves as a master coordinator for complete development workflows. The command will intelligently coordinate multiple subagents through research, planning, and implementation phases, utilizing parallel execution where beneficial and maintaining context preservation throughout the entire workflow.

This represents a significant evolution of the command ecosystem, transforming it from a collection of individual tools into a comprehensive orchestrated development platform.

**IMPORTANT**: This plan depends on the helper commands and infrastructure implemented in [003_orchestrate_helper_commands.md](003_orchestrate_helper_commands.md). The helper commands must be implemented first to provide the foundation for orchestration capabilities.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Command coordinates complete workflows from user description to validated solution
- [ ] Integration with helper command infrastructure (/coordination-hub, /resource-manager, etc.)
- [ ] Repository preparation via enhanced /setup for orchestration readiness
- [ ] Intelligent use of /report, /debug, /refactor for comprehensive research phases
- [ ] Seamless integration with /plan to create detailed implementation roadmaps
- [ ] Enhanced /implement execution with intelligent /subagents coordination
- [ ] Comprehensive testing phase following CLAUDE.md testing protocols
- [ ] Context preservation across all phases and agent invocations
- [ ] Automatic parallelization of suitable tasks within each phase
- [ ] Robust error handling with checkpoint-based recovery leveraging /workflow-recovery
- [ ] Real-time monitoring via /workflow-status integration
- [ ] Complete integration with specs/ directory structure and cross-linking
- [ ] Performance monitoring and orchestration metrics reporting via /performance-monitor

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
The `/orchestrate` command implements a **centralized coordinator with hierarchical delegation** pattern that integrates with the helper command infrastructure:

- **Primary Orchestrator**: Manages workflow state, coordinates phases, preserves context
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Leverages `/coordination-hub` for state management and `/resource-manager` for allocation
- **Phase Coordinators**: Specialized agents for research, planning, implementation, testing phases
- **Task Executors**: Individual agents executing specific tasks within phases
- **Monitoring Integration**: Uses `/workflow-status` for real-time progress tracking
- **Utility Integration**: Leverages enhanced `/subagents` for parallel execution optimization

### Core Components
