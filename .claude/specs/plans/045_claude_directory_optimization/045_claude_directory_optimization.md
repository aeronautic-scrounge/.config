## Overview

This plan optimizes the `.claude/` directory (353 files, 7.6M) by removing bloat, simplifying context-heavy components, and refactoring large utilities - while preserving all critical functionality including orchestration, adaptive planning, checkpoint resume, progressive structure, error recovery, and test infrastructure.

The plan is structured in 8 incremental phases with increasing complexity and time investment, allowing the user to stop at any point based on priorities and available time.

**New Phase 0** addresses recent bloat in orchestrate.md (285 lines of verbose documentation added during research phase enhancements) before tackling the broader optimization phases.

**Phase 7** provides a comprehensive, systematic modularization alternative using the proven `commands/shared/` pattern (like `agents/shared/`), offering more aggressive file size reductions than Phase 4.

## Technical Design

### Design Principles

1. **Zero Functionality Loss**: All critical features must be preserved
   - Orchestration, adaptive planning, checkpoint resume, progressive structure
   - Error recovery, test infrastructure
   - All documented commands and workflows

2. **Context Preservation**: Reduce context usage through extraction and consolidation
   - Extract verbose examples to reference files
   - Consolidate duplicate patterns
   - Reference external documentation instead of inline duplication

3. **Incremental Changes**: Each phase is self-contained and testable
   - Git commit after each phase
   - Test suite validation after each phase
   - Rollback capability at any point

4. **Modularization**: Break large files into focused, testable modules
   - Target: <500 lines per file
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reduced context per operation

### Architecture Decisions

**Phase 1 Architecture** (Bloat Removal):
- Simple file/directory deletion
- CLAUDE.md update to remove deprecated command references
- No code changes, minimal risk

**Phase 3 Architecture** (Context Optimization):
- Create `.claude/templates/` directory for extracted templates
- Create `.claude/docs/` subdirectories for reference files
- Update commands/agents to reference external files instead of inline content
- Maintain all functionality, reduce inline documentation

**Phase 4 Architecture** (Code Refactoring):
- Extract shared utilities to dedicated files:
  - `timestamp-utils.sh` - Platform-independent timestamp operations
  - `validation-utils.sh` - Common parameter validation
  - `json-utils-extended.sh` - Additional JSON helpers
- Split large utilities into focused modules:
  - `auto-analysis-utils.sh` → 4 modules (agent invocation, phase analysis, stage analysis, artifact mgmt)
  - `convert-docs.sh` → 3 modules (core, validation, parallel processing)
  - `parse-adaptive-plan.sh` → 4 modules (detection, expansion, collapse, metadata)
- Update all sourcing relationships to maintain functionality

**Phase 5 Architecture** (Structural Improvements):
- Standardize naming: `snake_case` → `hyphen-case` for all filenames
- Consolidate test fixtures into `.claude/tests/fixtures/`
- Clarify checkpoint directory purposes or consolidate

### Component Interactions

**Pre-Optimization**:
```
Commands (21) → Large Utilities (3 files, 4,555 lines) → Shared Utils (22 files)
              ↘ Large Agents (1 file, 1,871 lines)
```

**Post-Optimization**:
```
Commands (21) → Modular Utilities (9-12 files, <500 lines each) → Shared Utils (27 files)
              ↘ Reference Files (3 files) ← Commands/Agents reference
              ↘ Simplified Agents (1 file, ~800 lines)
```

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Git Checkpoints**: Commit after each phase for rollback capability
2. **Test Validation**: Run test suite after every change
3. **Smoke Testing**: Test key workflows (/orchestrate, /implement, /plan) after major changes
4. **User Confirmation**: Get approval before removing unused systems
5. **Backup Strategy**: Git history provides full version control

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Orchestrate.md Bloat Reduction (1-2 hours, Very Low Risk)

**Objective**: Remove ~285-310 lines of verbose documentation from orchestrate.md that was added during recent research phase enhancements

**Complexity**: Low
**Risk**: Very Low (removing duplicate/verbose content only, no functionality changes)
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Related Report**: `.claude/specs/reports/orchestrate_improvements/005_bloat_analysis_and_reduction_recommendations.md`

#### Context

Recent orchestrate research phase enhancements (commits 54a6ce5, 0cfb0a6, 5dce2b0, 9d90236) added ~1,000 lines to orchestrate.md to fix the Report 004 path inconsistency issue. While all changes address critical functionality, ~200-250 lines (20-25%) are verbose documentation that duplicates operational guidance already present in the workflow steps.

**Current State**: orchestrate.md is ~2,900 lines
**Target State**: orchestrate.md reduced to ~2,615 lines (285 lines removed)

#### Tasks

**Safety Checks**:
- [ ] Create git commit with current state (pre-Phase 0 checkpoint)
- [ ] Run full test suite: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
- [ ] Verify 90%+ tests passing baseline
- [ ] Document baseline test results

**Priority 1: Remove Troubleshooting Section** (-145 lines):
- [ ] Read `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` to locate troubleshooting section
- [ ] Locate section between "Troubleshooting: Research Phase" and "### Planning Phase" markers
- [ ] Verify troubleshooting issues are already covered in operational steps:
  - Issue 1 (Path Inconsistency): Prevented by Step 2, detected by Step 4.5, fixed by Step 4.6
  - Issue 2 (Metadata Incomplete): Handled by Step 4.5 verification
  - Issue 3 (Agent Failed): Covered by Step 4.6 retry logic
  - Issue 4 (Report Number Conflict): Already documented in Step 2
  - Issue 5 (Takes Too Long): General performance issue, not specific to enhancements
  - Issue 6 (All Agents Failed): Escalation logic in Step 4.6
- [ ] Remove entire troubleshooting section (~145 lines)
- [ ] Add brief inline notes in operational steps where relevant (e.g., "Common Issue: If report not found at expected path, search for it in alternative locations")
- [ ] Verify removal does not impact functionality (operational steps contain all necessary guidance)

**Priority 2: Condense Extended Examples** (-80-100 lines):
- [ ] Locate error output examples in Step 4.6 (~60 lines)
- [ ] Keep 2 critical examples: `file_not_found` and `path_mismatch`
- [ ] Remove verbose examples: `invalid_metadata`, `agent_crashed`, `permission_denied`
- [ ] Rationale: Error format is consistent, representative examples sufficient
- [ ] Locate full 3-agent parallel execution examples (~30 lines)
- [ ] Reduce to concise bullet points showing structure without verbose output
- [ ] Locate verification summary display examples (~20 lines)
- [ ] Consolidate to single format example (no need to repeat for variations)
- [ ] Verify examples still demonstrate key concepts clearly

**Priority 3: Remove Benefits Sections** (-45 lines):
- [ ] Locate "Why Absolute Paths Are Critical" section (~15 lines)
- [ ] Remove (benefits obvious from Step 2 logic)
- [ ] Locate "Benefits of Batch Verification" section (~15 lines)
- [ ] Remove (benefits obvious from Step 4.5 design)
- [ ] Locate "Benefits of Intelligent Retry" section (~15 lines)
- [ ] Remove (benefits obvious from Step 4.6 logic)
- [ ] Verify functionality remains clear without explanatory sections

**Priority 4: Condense TodoWrite Integration** (-15-20 lines):
- [ ] Locate TodoWrite integration examples with full JSON structures
- [ ] Replace with brief mention: "Research agents can be tracked as TodoWrite subtasks if desired"
- [ ] Remove verbose JSON examples (optional feature, not core workflow)

**Essential Content That MUST Remain**:
- [ ] Step 2: Determine Absolute Report Paths (algorithm, examples, workflow state)
- [ ] Step 3a: Monitor Research Agent Execution (progress markers, status tracking)
- [ ] Step 4.5: Verify Report Files (batch verification, path consistency, mismatch detection)
- [ ] Step 4.6: Retry Failed Reports (error classification, recovery workflow, retry strategy)
- [ ] All CRITICAL operational logic for Report 004 fix

**Validation**:
- [ ] Verify orchestrate.md reduced from ~2,900 to ~2,615 lines
- [ ] Verify all essential operational steps preserved
- [ ] Run test suite again: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
- [ ] Verify 90%+ tests still passing (no regressions)
- [ ] Smoke test: `/orchestrate --help`
- [ ] Test orchestrate workflow with simple task (dry-run if possible)

**Git Commit**:
- [ ] Stage changes: `git add .claude/commands/orchestrate.md`
- [ ] Create descriptive commit:
```bash
git commit -m "refactor: reduce orchestrate.md bloat by 285 lines

Remove verbose documentation that duplicates operational guidance.

Removals:
- Troubleshooting section (145 lines) - issues already covered in Steps 2, 4.5, 4.6
- Extended error examples (60 lines) - kept 2 critical examples, removed 3 verbose ones
- Full scenario examples (20 lines) - reduced to concise bullet points
- Benefits sections (45 lines) - obvious from functional descriptions
- TodoWrite examples (15 lines) - reduced to brief mention

Essential content preserved:
- All operational steps (Step 2, 3a, 4.5, 4.6)
- Critical specifications (paths, markers, verification, retry)
- Representative examples for key concepts

Result: orchestrate.md reduced from ~2,900 to ~2,615 lines (285 lines removed)
Risk: Very low - no functionality changes, duplicate content removed only

Testing:
- Full test suite passed (90%+)
- /orchestrate workflow functional
- No regressions detected

---

### Phase 5: Code Quality Refactoring (20-30 hours, Medium Effort) [CANCELLED]

**Status**: CANCELLED - User decision: Bash script modularization is not necessary

**Rationale**: After initial implementation of Parts 1-2, user determined that modularizing bash scripts adds unnecessary complexity without sufficient benefit. The existing utilities work well and are maintainable as-is. Both Part 1 (shared utilities) and Part 2 (auto-analysis-utils.sh modularization) have been reverted (commits 8829aa2 and a6a7b62).

**Original Objective**: Modularize 3 large utilities (4,555 lines) into 9-12 focused files (<500 lines each) and extract shared utilities

**Complexity**: High
**Risk**: Low (comprehensive testing after each change)
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete, user priority HIGH or MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours (full) or 5-6 hours (shared utilities only)

**NOTE**: This entire phase is now CANCELLED. All bash utilities will remain in their current monolithic form.

#### Part 1: Extract Shared Utilities (5-6 hours) [CANCELLED - REVERTED]

**Create timestamp-utils.sh**:
- [x] Create `.claude/lib/timestamp-utils.sh`
- [x] Extract platform-independent timestamp functions:
```bash
# get_file_mtime <file_path>
# Returns: Unix timestamp of file modification time
get_file_mtime() {
  local file="$1"
  stat -c %Y "$file" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %m "$file"
}

# format_timestamp [unix_timestamp]
# Returns: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
format_timestamp() {
  local ts="${1:-$(date +%s)}"
  date -d "@$ts" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' 2>/dev/null || date -r "$ts" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
}

# get_unix_time
# Returns: Current Unix timestamp
get_unix_time() {
  date '+%s'
}

# get_iso_date
# Returns: Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
get_iso_date() {
  date '+%Y-%m-%d'
}
```
- [x] Update files using timestamp operations to source timestamp-utils.sh:
  - `checkpoint-utils.sh:79`
  - `adaptive-planning-logger.sh:67`
  - [15+ other files]
- [x] Replace inline timestamp code with function calls
- [x] Test: Run commands that use timestamp operations

**Create validation-utils.sh**:
- [x] Create `.claude/lib/validation-utils.sh`
- [x] Extract common validation functions:
```bash
# require_param <param_name> <param_value> [error_message]
# Exits with error if parameter is empty
require_param() {
  local name="$1"
  local value="$2"
  local msg="${3:-Parameter '$name' is required}"
  [[ -z "$value" ]] && error "$msg" && return 1
  return 0
}

# validate_file_exists <file_path> [error_message]
# Returns 1 if file does not exist
validate_file_exists() {
  local file="$1"
  local msg="${2:-File not found: $file}"
  [[ ! -f "$file" ]] && error "$msg" && return 1
  return 0
}

# validate_dir_exists <dir_path> [error_message]
# Returns 1 if directory does not exist
validate_dir_exists() {
  local dir="$1"
  local msg="${2:-Directory not found: $dir}"
  [[ ! -d "$dir" ]] && error "$msg" && return 1
  return 0
}

# validate_number <value> [error_message]
# Returns 1 if value is not a number
validate_number() {
  local value="$1"
  local msg="${2:-Invalid number: $value}"
  [[ ! "$value" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && error "$msg" && return 1
  return 0
}
```
- [x] Update files using validation patterns to source validation-utils.sh
- [x] Replace inline validation (15+ instances) with function calls
- [x] Test: Run commands with invalid parameters to verify validation

**Create json-utils-extended.sh** (if needed):
- [x] Review existing `json-utils.sh`
- [x] Identify additional JSON manipulation patterns used in multiple files
- [x] Extract to json-utils-extended.sh if patterns are reusable (DECISION: Not needed, existing json-utils.sh sufficient)
- [x] Update files to source and use extended JSON utilities
- [x] Test: Run commands that build/parse JSON

**Update All Sourcing**:
- [x] Find all files sourcing utilities with timestamp operations
- [x] Add `. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/timestamp-utils.sh"` or similar
- [x] Find all files with validation patterns
- [x] Add `. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/validation-utils.sh"` or similar
- [x] Verify no circular dependencies introduced (Fixed by avoiding error-utils.sh sourcing)

**Validation After Part 1**:
- [x] Run test suite: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
- [x] Verify 90%+ tests passing (36/36 adaptive planning tests passed)
- [x] Test commands that use new shared utilities
- [x] Verify code duplication reduced
- [x] Git commit: "feat: extract shared utilities (timestamp, validation) for code quality" (Commit: c79c628)

**Decision Point**: If user priority is MEDIUM, STOP after Part 1. If user priority is HIGH, continue with Parts 2-4.

```bash
function_name() {
  require_param "param1" "$1" || return 1
  require_param "param2" "$2" || return 1
  validate_file_exists "$3" || return 1

  # Function logic...
}
```
- [ ] Use validation-utils.sh functions

#### Part 3: Test Fixture Organization (1-2 hours)

**Create Test Fixtures Directory**:
- [ ] Create `.claude/tests/fixtures/` directory
- [ ] Create `.claude/tests/fixtures/plans/` subdirectory

**Move Test Plans**:
- [ ] Find test plans: `find .claude/specs/plans -name "test_*.md"`

- [ ] Move any valid checkpoints from `.claude/data/checkpoints/` to `.claude/checkpoints/`
- [ ] Update checkpoint-utils.sh to use single directory
- [ ] Remove redundant directory

**If Different Purposes**:
- [ ] Document distinction in checkpoint-utils.sh header

- [ ] Git commit: "refactor: clarify checkpoint directory structure"

#### Part 5: Handle Unused Systems (Based on Phase 2 Decisions)

**If Template System = REMOVE**:
- [ ] Remove commands:
  - `rm .claude/commands/plan-wizard.md`
  - `rm .claude/commands/plan-from-template.md`
- [ ] Remove utilities:
  - `rm .claude/lib/parse-template.sh`

- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to remove template command references

**If Template System = ARCHIVE**:
- [ ] Create `.claude/archive/template-system/` directory
- [ ] Move all template components to archive
- [ ] Create archive README explaining system and completion status
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to note system is archived

**If TTS System = REMOVE**:
- [ ] Remove TTS core:

**Validation After Part 5**:
- [ ] Run test suite: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
- [ ] Verify removed systems not referenced anywhere:
  - `grep -r "plan-wizard" .claude/commands/ .claude/lib/` (should be empty)
  - `grep -r "tts-" .claude/commands/ .claude/lib/` (should be empty if removed)
- [ ] Git commit: "refactor: remove/archive unused systems per user decision"

#### Phase 5 Testing

```bash

find .claude -name "*_*.md"  # Should only show README files if any
find .claude -name "*_*.sh"  # Should only show test_*.sh if keeping pattern

# Verify test fixtures accessible
ls .claude/tests/fixtures/plans/

# Verify checkpoint functionality
/implement --dry-run [test-plan]  # Should create checkpoint
ls .claude/checkpoints/  # Verify checkpoint created

# Verify unused systems removed/archived
ls .claude/commands/plan-wizard.md 2>/dev/null  # Should not exist if removed
ls .claude/tts/ 2>/dev/null  # Should not exist if removed

# Calculate final directory size
du -sh .claude/
# Compare to baseline (should be ~679KB smaller + any unused systems removed)
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Consistent naming conventions (all hyphens, no underscores except test_ if kept)
- Single authoritative README in lib/

- [ ] Git commits created for each part

**Phase 6 Status**: PENDING

---

### Phase 7: Directory Modularization (15-20 hours, Medium-High Effort)

**Objective**: Systematic modularization using `commands/shared/` pattern (proven from `agents/shared/`) with comprehensive utility consolidation

**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Risk**: Low (incremental changes, comprehensive testing)
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 hours (5 phases)
**Status**: PENDING

**NOTE**: This phase provides a more comprehensive, systematic alternative to Phase 4 (Context Optimization). It uses the proven `commands/shared/` pattern and includes utility consolidation. Consider this phase as an enhanced replacement for Phase 4 if maximum modularization is desired.

**Summary**: The directory modularization implements industry-standard reference-based composition (commands/shared/ pattern like agents/shared/), achieving dramatic file size reductions: orchestrate.md (6,341 → ~1,200 lines, 81% reduction), implement.md (1,803 → ~700 lines, 61% reduction). The approach consolidates overlapping utilities, extracts reusable documentation to shared sections, and applies 2025 best practices (250-line file threshold, SRP, template composition).

For detailed implementation tasks and specifications, see [phase_7_directory_modularization.md](phase_7_directory_modularization.md).

#### Phase 7 Overview

**Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis** (2-3 hours):
- Create `.claude/commands/shared/` directory structure
- Inventory extraction candidates from orchestrate.md and implement.md
- Tag sections with line ranges for extraction
- Run baseline tests (100% passing required before proceeding)
- Create extraction plan spreadsheet

**Phase 2: Extract orchestrate.md Documentation** (5-6 hours):
- Extract workflow phase descriptions to `shared/workflow-phases.md` (~800 lines)
- Extract error recovery patterns to `shared/error-recovery.md` (~400 lines)
- Extract context management guide to `shared/context-management.md` (~300 lines)
- Extract agent coordination patterns to `shared/agent-coordination.md` (~500 lines)
- Extract examples to `shared/orchestrate-examples.md` (~400 lines)
- Update orchestrate.md with references and summaries
- Target: 6,341 → ~1,200 lines (81% reduction)

**Phase 3: Extract implement.md Documentation** (3-4 hours):
- Extract adaptive planning guide to `shared/adaptive-planning.md` (~200 lines)
- Extract progressive structure docs to `shared/progressive-structure.md` (~150 lines)
- Extract phase execution protocol to `shared/phase-execution.md` (~180 lines)
- Update implement.md with references and summaries
- Create cross-reference inventory
- Target: 1,803 → ~700 lines (61% reduction)

**Phase 4: Consolidate Utility Libraries** (3-4 hours):
- Inventory functions in artifact-utils.sh (878 lines), auto-analysis-utils.sh (1,755 lines), checkpoint-utils.sh (769 lines)
- Identify duplicate/overlapping functions
- Create consolidated artifact-management.sh
- Extract common checkpoint initialization pattern to `lib/checkpoint-template.sh`
- Update 9+ commands to use checkpoint template
- Create/update `lib/README.md` with function inventory

**Phase 5: Documentation, Testing, and Validation** (2-3 hours):
- Update `.claude/commands/README.md` to describe shared/ pattern
- Update `.claude/README.md` with new modular architecture
- Add architecture diagram showing command→shared references
- Create test for validating markdown references: `test_command_references.sh`
- Run complete test suite with ≥80% coverage
- Validate all success criteria
- Run integration tests with real workflows

#### Phase 7 Success Criteria

- [ ] orchestrate.md reduced from 6,341 to <1,500 lines (target: ~1,200)
- [ ] implement.md reduced from 1,803 to <800 lines (target: ~700)
- [ ] commands/shared/ directory created with 8-10 reusable sections
- [ ] Overlapping utility functions consolidated
- [ ] All existing commands continue to function correctly
- [ ] Test suite passes with ≥80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation follows clean-break refactor philosophy
- [ ] test_command_references.sh validates all markdown links
- [ ] Architecture diagram shows command→shared references
- [ ] Cross-reference inventory completed

**Phase 7 Status**: PENDING

**Key Differences from Phase 4**:
- Uses structured `commands/shared/` pattern (like `agents/shared/`) instead of ad-hoc `.claude/docs/` files
- More aggressive reduction targets (orchestrate.md: 81% vs 47%, implement.md: 61% vs 45%)
- Includes utility consolidation not covered in Phase 4
- Comprehensive validation testing with reference link verification
- Industry-standard approach (2025 best practices: 250-line threshold, SRP)

**Note**: Phase 7 and Phase 4 address similar goals with different approaches. Choose one based on desired outcomes:
- **Phase 4**: Moderate reduction, simpler approach, faster completion (8-10 hours)
- **Phase 7**: Maximum reduction, systematic approach, comprehensive testing (15-20 hours)

## Testing Strategy

### Per-Phase Testing

**After Each Phase**:
1. Run full test suite: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
2. Verify 90%+ tests passing (no regressions)
3. Smoke test key workflows affected by changes
4. Git commit with descriptive message

### Test Suite Locations

**Unit Tests**:
- `.claude/tests/test_parsing_utilities.sh` - Plan parsing functions
- `.claude/tests/test_complexity_*.sh` - Complexity analysis
- `.claude/tests/test_shared_utilities.sh` - Utility library functions

**Integration Tests**:
- `.claude/tests/test_command_integration.sh` - Command workflows
- `.claude/tests/test_adaptive_planning.sh` - Adaptive planning integration
- `.claude/tests/test_revise_automode.sh` - Revise auto-mode integration

**Regression Tests**:
- `.claude/tests/test_progressive_*.sh` - Progressive structure (expansion/collapse)
- `.claude/tests/test_state_management.sh` - Checkpoint operations

### Smoke Tests

**Key Workflows to Test**:
```bash
# Plan creation
/plan "test feature" --dry-run

# Implementation (dry-run)
/implement [test-plan] --dry-run

# Orchestration (dry-run)
/orchestrate "test workflow" --dry-run

# Progressive structure
/expand [test-plan] [phase-num]
/collapse [expanded-plan] [phase-num]

# Conversion (if Phase 4 executed)
/convert-docs [test-dir] --dry-run
```

### Test Pass Criteria

**Minimum Requirements**:
- Overall pass rate: ≥90%
- Critical path tests: 100% (parsing, checkpoints, error recovery)
- No new failures introduced (compare to baseline)

**If Tests Fail**:
1. Identify root cause
2. Rollback to last successful git commit
3. Fix issue
4. Re-test before proceeding

## Documentation Requirements

### Update After Phase 1
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to remove `/update` from command list
- [ ] No other documentation changes needed (removal only)

### Update After Phase 3
- [ ] Add README in `.claude/templates/` explaining orchestration-patterns.md
- [ ] Add README in `.claude/docs/` explaining reference files (command-examples.md, logging-patterns.md)
- [ ] Update command documentation to reference external files where applicable

### Update After Phase 4
- [ ] Add README in `.claude/lib/` explaining modular structure
- [ ] Document sourcing relationships between modules
- [ ] Update utility documentation to reflect new organization

### Update After Phase 5
- [ ] Update `.claude/lib/README.md` if consolidated
- [ ] Document test fixture organization in `.claude/tests/README.md`
- [ ] Document checkpoint directory purposes (if clarified)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if TTS system documented or template/TTS systems removed

### Final Documentation Review
- [ ] Ensure all READMEs accurate and complete
- [ ] Verify no broken links in documentation
- [ ] Update any outdated references to old file locations
- [ ] Generate workflow summary (via /orchestrate at completion)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Git (version control for checkpoints and rollback)
- Bash 4.0+ (for shell utilities)
- jq (JSON manipulation, required for Phase 4 Part 5)
- awk (pattern processing, required for Phase 4 Part 5)

### Internal Dependencies

**Phase 1**: None (standalone removal)

**Phase 2**: Phase 1 complete (requires clean baseline)

**Phase 3**:
- Phase 2 complete (user decisions needed)
- No code dependencies (creates new files)

**Phase 4**:
- Phase 2 complete (user decisions needed)
- Requires test infrastructure functional
- Part 4 depends on Parts 1-3 (modularization builds on shared utilities)

**Phase 5**:
- Phase 2 complete (user decisions needed)
- Optional: Phase 3 complete (template directory already exists)
- Optional: Phase 4 complete (library structure already modular)

## Risk Assessment

### Phase-by-Phase Risk

| Phase | Functionality Risk | Rollback Complexity | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Very Low | Very Low | Git history, test validation |
| Phase 2 | None | N/A | Planning only, no code changes |
| Phase 3 | Very Low | Low | Reference files separate, easy rollback |
| Phase 4 | Low | Medium | Comprehensive testing, incremental commits |
| Phase 5 | Very Low | Low | Mostly organizational, easy rollback |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Git Checkpoints**: Commit after each phase/part for granular rollback
2. **Test Validation**: Run test suite after every change
3. **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable changes within each phase
4. **User Confirmation**: Get approval before removing unused systems (Phase 2)
5. **Smoke Testing**: Test key workflows after major changes

### Rollback Procedures

**If Tests Fail**:
```bash
# Rollback to last successful commit
git log --oneline  # Find last good commit
git reset --hard [commit-hash]

# Re-run tests to verify
.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh

# Investigate issue before retrying
```

**If Functionality Lost**:
```bash
# Rollback entire phase
git log --oneline --grep="Phase [N]"  # Find phase commits
git reset --hard [commit-before-phase]

# Re-run tests
.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh

# Reassess approach for that phase
```

### Final Validation

**Comprehensive Test**:
- [ ] Run full test suite: `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`
- [ ] Verify 90%+ pass rate
- [ ] Test all documented commands in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Verify all workflows functional:
  - `/orchestrate` end-to-end workflow
  - `/implement` with checkpoint resume
  - `/plan` with complexity analysis
  - `/revise --auto-mode` integration
  - `/expand` and `/collapse` operations

**Metrics Calculation**:
- [ ] Calculate final directory size: `du -sh .claude/`
- [ ] Compare to baseline (should be ≥679KB smaller)
- [ ] Count files: `find .claude -type f | wc -l` (should be fewer)
- [ ] Verify line count reductions in large components
- [ ] Verify modularization (no files >500 lines except legacy)

## Notes

### Implementation Approach

This plan uses a **phased, incremental approach** with the following principles:

1. **Safety First**: Git commits after each phase, test validation after every change
2. **User Control**: Phase 2 allows user to prioritize based on time/value
3. **Incremental Value**: Each phase provides value independently
4. **Rollback Capability**: Git history enables rollback at any point
5. **Zero Functionality Loss**: All critical features preserved throughout

### Stopping Points

**User can stop after any phase**:

- **After Phase 0** (1-2 hours): Recent orchestrate.md bloat removed (211 lines savings)
- **After Phase 1** (1-2 hours): Historic bloat removed, cleaner directory (679KB savings)
- **After Phase 2** (30 min): Decisions made, clear path forward
- **After Phase 3** (10-15 hours): Template system complete, workflow templates enabled
- **After Phase 4** (8-10 hours): Context optimized (35% reduction), moderate file size reductions
- **After Phase 5 Part 1** (5-6 hours): Shared utilities extracted, foundation for modularity
- **After Phase 5** (20-30 hours): Full code quality refactoring, maximum maintainability
- **After Phase 6** (4-6 hours): Structural polish, organized directory structure
- **After Phase 7** (15-20 hours): Systematic modularization, aggressive file size reductions (alternative to Phase 4)

**Recommended Minimum**: Execute Phases 0-1-2-3 (14-20 hours) for foundational work, then choose Path A (Phase 4) or Path B (Phase 7) based on priorities.

### Critical Functionality Preservation

**Must Preserve** (verified in testing):
- Orchestration workflows (/orchestrate command)
- Adaptive planning (auto-replan during /implement)
- Checkpoint resume (smart auto-resume in /implement)
- Progressive structure (Level 0/1/2 with /expand and /collapse)
- Error recovery (4-level tiered recovery)
- Test infrastructure (90%+ pass rate maintained)

**All phases designed to preserve these features - NO exceptions.**

### Estimated Timeline

**Minimum (Phase 0 only)**: 1-2 hours (recent bloat reduction)
**Quick Win (Phases 0-1)**: 2-4 hours (all bloat removed)
**Foundation (Phases 0-1-2-3)**: 14-20 hours (bloat + template system)
**Path A - Context Optimization (Phases 0-1-2-3-4-5-6)**: 44-65 hours (traditional approach)
**Path B - Directory Modularization (Phases 0-1-2-3-7-5-6)**: 49-70 hours (systematic approach)
**Maximum (all phases, both paths)**: 64-90 hours (complete overhaul with both approaches)

**User controls scope via Phase 2 decisions and path selection.**

## Implementation Summary

This plan optimizes the .claude/ directory in 8 incremental phases:

0. **Phase 0** (1-2h): Remove 285 lines of recent bloat from orchestrate.md - verbose documentation, duplicate examples
1. **Phase 1** (1-2h): Remove 679KB of historic bloat - backups, deprecated commands, temp files
2. **Phase 2** (30m): User decisions on unused systems and optimization priorities
3. **Phase 3** (10-15h): Template system completion - finish 40% complete system with 4 focused phases
4. **Phase 4** (8-10h): Context optimization - 35% reduction (5,850 lines) through extraction and consolidation
5. **Phase 5** (20-30h): Code quality refactoring - modularize 3 large utilities (4,555 lines) into 9-12 focused files
6. **Phase 6** (4-6h): Structural improvements - naming consistency, fixture organization, cleanup
7. **Phase 7** (15-20h): Directory modularization - systematic `commands/shared/` pattern, 81% orchestrate.md reduction, 61% implement.md reduction

**Optimization Paths**:

**Path A** (Context Optimization): Phases 0-1-2-3-4-5-6 (44-65 hours)
- Traditional approach with moderate reductions
- Phase 4: orchestrate.md 5,628 → ~3,000 lines (47% reduction)

**Path B** (Directory Modularization): Phases 0-1-2-3-7-5-6 (49-70 hours)
- Systematic approach with maximum reductions
- Phase 7: orchestrate.md 6,341 → ~1,200 lines (81% reduction)
- Uses proven `commands/shared/` pattern

**Total Optimization**: 285 lines orchestrate.md + 679KB bloat + template system completion + **either** 5,850 lines context (Phase 4) **or** 9,000+ lines modularization (Phase 7) + 4,555 lines modularized utilities = Cleaner, more maintainable .claude/ directory with **zero functionality loss**.

**Recommended Path**: Execute Phases 0-1-2-3 (14-20 hours) for foundational work, then choose Phase 4 (moderate) or Phase 7 (aggressive) based on time/value priorities.

**Success Guarantee**: Git checkpoints, comprehensive testing, and incremental changes ensure safe optimization with rollback capability at every step.

## Revision History

### 2025-10-13 - Revision 1: Add Phase 0 for Orchestrate.md Bloat Reduction

**Changes Made**:
- Added new Phase 0: Orchestrate.md Bloat Reduction (1-2 hours)
- Updated plan from 5 phases to 6 phases
- Updated metadata: Changed "Estimated Phases" from 5 to 6
- Updated metadata: Changed "Expanded Phases" from [3, 4] to [4, 5] (phase numbers shifted)
- Updated metadata: Added second research report (005_bloat_analysis_and_reduction_recommendations.md)
- Updated metadata: Added "Total Optimization Potential" to include 285 lines orchestrate.md
- Updated Success Criteria to include Phase 0 success metrics
- Updated Overview to mention Phase 0
- Updated Stopping Points to include Phase 0 (1-2 hours)
- Updated Estimated Timeline to reflect new phase
- Updated Implementation Summary to include Phase 0

**Reason for Revision**:
Recent orchestrate research phase enhancements (commits 54a6ce5, 0cfb0a6, 5dce2b0, 9d90236) added ~1,000 lines to orchestrate.md. Post-implementation analysis revealed ~285 lines (20-25%) are verbose documentation that duplicates operational guidance. This bloat was created AFTER the original plan was drafted and needs to be addressed before the broader context optimization in Phase 3 (now Phase 4).

**Reports Used**:
- `.claude/specs/reports/orchestrate_improvements/005_bloat_analysis_and_reduction_recommendations.md`

**Modified Phases**:
- New Phase 0: Orchestrate.md Bloat Reduction (addresses recent bloat, 285 lines)
- Phase 1: Bloat Removal (unchanged, addresses historic bloat, 679KB)
- Phase 2: User Decision Points (unchanged)
- Phase 3: Context Optimization (unchanged, now includes additional bloat from Phase 0)
- Phase 4: Code Quality Refactoring (unchanged)
- Phase 5: Structural Improvements (unchanged)

**Phase Numbering Change**:
All original phases shifted by +1:
- Original Phase 1 → New Phase 1 (unchanged content)
- Original Phase 2 → New Phase 2 (unchanged content)
- Original Phase 3 → New Phase 4 (expanded phase file: phase_3_context_optimization.md)
- Original Phase 4 → New Phase 5 (expanded phase file: phase_4_code_quality_refactoring.md)
- Original Phase 5 → New Phase 6 (not yet created as expanded file)

**Note**: The expanded phase files (phase_3_context_optimization.md and phase_4_code_quality_refactoring.md) still use their original numbering (3 and 4) and refer to the content that is now Phase 4 and Phase 5 in the main plan. This is acceptable as the phase content itself is unchanged - only the position in the sequence has shifted due to the insertion of Phase 0.

**Impact**:
- Estimated total time: 33-48 hours → 34-50 hours (added 1-2 hours for Phase 0)
- Recommended minimum: Phases 1-3 (9-12 hours) → Phases 0-3 (10-14 hours)
- Total optimization potential: 679KB bloat + 5,850 lines → 679KB bloat + 285 lines orchestrate.md + 5,850 lines
- Zero impact on functionality or technical design
- No changes to Phase 2 user decision points
- No changes to test strategy or risk assessment
