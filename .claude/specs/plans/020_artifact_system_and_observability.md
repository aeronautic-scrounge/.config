- [ ] Artifacts stored in `specs/artifacts/project_name/` structure
- [ ] Agent performance tracking captures all subagent executions
- [ ] `/analyze-agents` command provides actionable insights
- [ ] Reports/plans/summaries can reference artifacts
- [ ] Documentation complete for artifact system and agent tracking
- [ ] 60-80% reduction in context passed to agents (measured)
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing workflows

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2.1: Artifact Registry Foundation [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Create basic artifact storage and referencing infrastructure
**Complexity**: Medium
**Effort**: 4 hours

Tasks:
- [x] Add artifact registry to `/orchestrate` workflow state
  - Define registry data structure (artifact_id → file_path mapping)
  - Initialize registry at workflow start
  - Persist registry in workflow state
- [x] Implement artifact storage logic
  - Auto-generate project names from workflow description
  - Create `specs/artifacts/{project_name}/` directories
  - Save research outputs as artifacts with descriptive names
  - Return artifact references to orchestrator
- [x] Update `research-specialist` to support artifact output
  - Add artifact mode documentation to agent
  - Document artifact file structure
  - Explain artifact output process and benefits
- [x] Document artifact creation process
  - Documented in `/orchestrate` Steps 3.5, 4, 5
  - Ready for implementation when orchestrate workflow runs

Testing:
```bash
# Test artifact creation
/orchestrate "Simple test feature requiring research"

# Verify artifact structure
ls -la .claude/specs/artifacts/
cat .claude/specs/artifacts/test_feature/*.md

# Check artifact references
# (inspect workflow state - would need debug output)
```

Expected Outcomes:
- Artifacts successfully created in `specs/artifacts/`
- Project-specific subdirectories auto-generated
- Artifact references captured in workflow state

  - Include artifact paths in agent prompt
- [x] Update `plan-architect` prompt template
  - Add artifact reference section
  - Instruct agent to Read artifacts selectively
  - Document artifact usage pattern
- [x] Implement selective artifact retrieval
  - Agent reads only relevant artifacts
  - Combines findings as needed
  - Cites artifacts in plan output
- [x] Add artifact cross-referencing to plans
  - Plans include "## Related Artifacts" section
  - Lists artifacts used during planning
  - Links to artifact files
- [x] Update plan template with artifact references
  - Added "Related Artifacts" section to /plan command
  - Documented cross-referencing guidelines
  - Ready for reports/summaries updates in future phases

Testing:
```bash
# Test artifact reference system
/orchestrate "Complex feature with multiple research topics"

# Verify plan references artifacts
grep -A 5 "Related Artifacts" .claude/specs/plans/[latest].md

# Check context size reduction (manual comparison)
# Before: ~450 words passed to plan-architect
# After: ~50 words (artifact refs) + selective reads
```

Expected Outcomes:
- Plan-architect receives artifact refs, not full content
- Plans include artifact references section
- Measured 60-80% reduction in context size

# - code-writer: 4.4% failures due to syntax errors, improve validation
```

Expected Outcomes:

- Underperforming agents identified
- Specific recommendations provided

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test artifact storage in isolation
- Test agent registry updates
- Test analysis calculations

### Integration Testing
- Run complete `/orchestrate` workflow
- Verify artifacts created and referenced
- Confirm agent metrics collected
- Generate analysis report

### Performance Testing
- Measure context size before/after artifact refs
- Verify 60-80% reduction claim
- Check metrics overhead (should be < 100ms)

### Backward Compatibility
- Ensure existing workflows still function
- Artifact system optional (graceful fallback)
- No breaking changes to existing plans

## Documentation Requirements

### New Documentation Files
- [ ] `.claude/docs/artifact-system-guide.md`
  - Artifact organization and naming
  - Usage patterns and examples
  - Cross-referencing guidelines
  - Lifecycle management

- [ ] `.claude/docs/agent-performance-tracking.md`
  - Metrics collection explanation
  - Interpreting performance reports
  - Optimization strategies
  - Troubleshooting guide

### Updated Documentation
- [ ] `.claude/commands/README.md`
  - Add `/analyze-agents` to command list
  - Update `/orchestrate` with artifact info

- [ ] `.claude/agents/README.md`
  - Document performance tracking
  - Explain efficiency scores

- [ ] `.claude/specs/artifacts/README.md`
  - Already created in Phase 1
  - May need minor updates based on implementation

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Requires Phase 1 completion (metrics fixes, retry logic)
- Builds on existing `/orchestrate` command
- Uses existing specs/ directory structure

### External
- None (all using existing infrastructure)

### Execution Order
- Must complete phases 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 sequentially
- 2.3 and 2.4 could run in parallel if needed

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Components
- Artifact reference system (changes core `/orchestrate` behavior)
- SubagentStop hook (new hook event, may need testing)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement artifact system as optional feature first
- Test with simple workflows before complex ones
- Add fallback to full content if artifact read fails
- Monitor metrics overhead

### Rollback Plan
- Can disable artifact system via feature flag
- Can remove SubagentStop hook from settings
- Agent-registry.json can be deleted/reset

## Notes

### Design Decisions

**Artifact Storage Location**: `specs/artifacts/project_name/`
- Keeps artifacts with related specs
- Project-specific organization for reuse
- Separate from final reports (cleaner organization)

**Artifact Naming**: Descriptive names, not numbered
- `existing_patterns.md` vs `artifact_001.md`
- Easier to understand and reference
- Self-documenting

**Agent Metrics**: JSON file vs database
- Simple JSON for now (sufficient for single user)
- Could migrate to SQLite later if needed
- Easy to inspect and modify manually

**Efficiency Score Weighting**: 60% success, 40% speed
- Success rate more important than speed
- Still incentivizes performance optimization
- Adjustable based on experience

### Future Enhancements (Post-Plan)
- Artifact versioning (track changes over time)
- Artifact search/discovery tools
- Agent performance dashboards
- Historical trend visualization
- Automated optimization suggestions
