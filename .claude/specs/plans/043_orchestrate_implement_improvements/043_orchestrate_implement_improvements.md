## Revision History

### 2025-10-13 - Revision 3
**Changes**: Fixed research report handling approach in Phase 5
**Reason**: Planning agent should read report files directly, not receive pre-loaded content
**Reports Used**: N/A (architectural clarification)
**Modified Phases**: Phase 5 - Research Report Integration task
**Key Changes**:
- Changed from "pass report content" to "pass report paths"
- Planning agent instructed to use Read tool for report analysis
- Preserves report paths in plan metadata for traceability
- Maintains separation of concerns between research and planning phases

### 2025-10-12 - Revision 2
**Changes**: Merged Plan 044 (Smart Implementation Workflow Enhancements) into Plan 043
**Reason**: Plans are complementary - 043 focuses on performance/infrastructure, 044 on UX/interruption reduction
**Reports Used**: Plans 043 and 044, reports 031 and 037 adaptation analysis
**Modified Phases**: Extended to 6 phases (0-5) incorporating both plans
**Key Additions from Plan 044**:
- Smart checkpoint auto-resume (reduces 90% of resume prompts)
- Automatic /debug integration on test failures
- Hybrid complexity evaluation (threshold + agent for borderline cases)
- Enhanced error handling with user choice prompts (r/c/s/a)
**Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 0: Foundation (unchanged from 043)
- Phase 1: Merged checkpoint auto-resume (044) + error recovery (043)
- Phase 2: Parallel execution (043 - already expanded)
- Phase 3: Merged auto-debug (044) + dashboard (043)
- Phase 4: Hybrid complexity (044) + partial metrics (043)
- Phase 5: Refactoring + documentation (merged from both)

### 2025-10-12 - Revision 1
**Changes**: Complete overhaul to leverage existing .claude/lib/ utilities
**Reason**: Analysis revealed 67% redundancy with existing infrastructure
**Reports Used**: 044_plan_043_revision_recommendations.md
**Modified Phases**: All phases restructured; added Phase 0 for foundation integration
**Key Changes**:
- Added Phase 0: Foundation Integration (prerequisite)
- Phase 1: Changed from "create retry-with-backoff" to "integrate error-utils.sh"
- Phase 2: Changed from "create parallel-executor" to "use parse-phase-dependencies.sh + inline logic"
- Phase 3: Changed from "add recovery functions" to "integrate existing recovery + create dashboard"
- Phase 4: Changed from "create agent-invocation" to "integrate agent-registry-utils.sh"
- Reduced duration: 13-17 sessions → 9-11 sessions (35% reduction)
- Reduced new utilities: 6 → 2 (progress-dashboard.sh, workflow-metrics.sh)

- Performance targets achieved (40-60% time reduction, 90% auto-resume, 50% faster debug)

## Overview

This plan implements comprehensive improvements to the /orchestrate and /implement commands through **two complementary strategies**:

1. **Performance & Infrastructure** (Plan 043): Leveraging existing mature utilities for parallel execution, error recovery, and metrics
2. **Workflow UX Enhancements** (Plan 044): Reducing interruptions through smart auto-resume, automatic debug integration, and hybrid complexity evaluation

**Key Strategy**: Integration over recreation + Intelligence layers over manual prompts

**Improvements Delivered**:
- **40-60% performance gains** through parallel phase execution with wave-based coordination
- **90% reduction in resume prompts** via smart checkpoint auto-resume with safety checks
- **50% faster debug workflows** through automatic /debug integration on test failures
- **Significantly improved reliability** via existing retry-with-backoff and tiered error recovery
- **Smarter decision-making** with hybrid complexity evaluation (thresholds + agent analysis)
- **Professional user experience** with progress dashboard, clear choices, and graceful fallbacks
- **Maintainable codebase** through utility integration, extraction, and focused refactoring

**Existing Infrastructure Leveraged**:
- error-utils.sh (700+ lines): retry_with_backoff, error classification, recovery strategies
- parse-phase-dependencies.sh: wave generation for parallel execution
- checkpoint-utils.sh: robust checkpoint management with schema migration
- complexity-utils.sh: comprehensive complexity analysis
- adaptive-planning-logger.sh: structured logging infrastructure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Commands Layer                                       │
│  ├─ /implement (uses shared utilities)             │

```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Integration First, Creation Second**
- Source all existing utilities before implementing phases
- Replace inline logic with shared utility functions
- Only create utilities that genuinely don't exist

**2. Hybrid Complexity Evaluation (Updated from Plan 044)**
- Use complexity-utils.sh thresholds as baseline (fast, proven)
- Add agent-based evaluation for borderline cases (score >=7 or tasks >=8)
- Agent provides context-aware analysis when threshold scoring ambiguous
- Threshold scoring remains fallback if agent fails
- Learn from score discrepancies to improve threshold accuracy over time

**3. Wave-Based Parallel Execution with parse-phase-dependencies.sh**
- Reuse existing wave generation (already implemented)
- Add inline parallel invocation logic (simple, doesn't justify separate utility)
- Max 3 concurrent phases per wave

**4. Tiered Error Recovery Using error-utils.sh**
- Level 1: detect_error_type() + generate_suggestions() (already exist)
- Level 2: retry_with_timeout() (already exists)
- Level 3: retry_with_fallback() (already exists)
- Level 4: Debug agent invocation

**5. Incremental Rollout**
- New features behind flags (--dashboard, --dry-run)
- Graceful fallbacks (ANSI dashboard → PROGRESS markers)
- Backward compatibility maintained

**6. Smart Workflow Automation (From Plan 044)**
- Auto-resume checkpoints when all safety conditions met (no prompt)
- Auto-invoke /debug on test failures (no "should I debug?" prompt)
- Present clear user choices (r/c/s/a) with explanations
- Reduce interruptions while maintaining control points

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Integration (NEW - PREREQUISITE) [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Integrate existing utilities into commands before adding new features
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Duration**: 1-2 sessions
**Priority**: Critical (prerequisite for all other phases)

**Rationale**: Commands currently document utility usage but don't actually source them. This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent improvements.

Tasks:
- [x] Add utility sourcing to /implement command
  - Source detect-project-dir.sh
  - Source error-utils.sh
  - Source checkpoint-utils.sh
  - Source complexity-utils.sh
  - Source adaptive-planning-logger.sh
  - Source agent-registry-utils.sh
- [x] Add utility sourcing to /orchestrate command
  - Source same utilities as /implement
  - Add sourcing at command initialization
- [x] Replace inline retry logic with retry_with_backoff()
  - Find inline retry implementations in commands
  - Replace with retry_with_backoff calls
  - Update parameters to match existing function signature
- [x] Replace inline error handling with error-utils.sh functions
  - Use classify_error() instead of inline classification
  - Use suggest_recovery() for recovery options
  - Use format_error_report() for structured output
- [x] Replace inline checkpoint logic with checkpoint-utils.sh functions
  - Use save_checkpoint() instead of manual JSON
  - Use restore_checkpoint() for resumption
  - Use validate_checkpoint() before loading
- [x] Replace inline logging with adaptive-planning-logger.sh functions
  - Use log_trigger_evaluation() for adaptive triggers
  - Use log_complexity_check() for complexity evaluations
  - Use log_replan_invocation() for replanning
- [x] Test integration with existing workflows
  - Run /implement on test plan
  - Run /orchestrate on simple workflow
  - Verify utilities sourced correctly
- [x] Verify no regressions in command behavior
  - Compare before/after behavior
  - Check that all tests still pass
  - Validate log output format

Testing:
```bash
# Verify utilities are sourced correctly
/implement test_plan.md  # Should use shared utilities
/orchestrate "simple feature"  # Should use shared retry logic

# Check logs for utility function calls
grep "retry_with_backoff" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log
grep "classify_error" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log
grep "save_checkpoint" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log

# Verify no regressions
.claude/tests/test_command_integration.sh
```

**Expected Impact**: Foundation for all subsequent phases, eliminates redundancy, ensures consistency

### Phase 1: Smart Checkpoint & Error Recovery (merged) [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Implement smart auto-resume and integrate error-utils.sh for reliable error handling
**Complexity**: Medium (merged from 043 Phase 1 + 044 Phase 1)
**Duration**: 3-4 sessions
**Sources**: 043 Phase 1 (error recovery) + 044 Phase 1 (smart auto-resume)

**What's Merged**: Combines intelligent checkpoint resumption with battle-tested error recovery

Tasks:

**Smart Checkpoint Auto-Resume** (from 044 Phase 1):

  - Check plan not modified since checkpoint
  - Check status = "in_progress"
- [x] Add smart resume logic to /implement
  - Call check_safe_resume_conditions before interactive prompt
  - Auto-resume silently if all conditions met
  - Log: "Auto-resuming from Phase N (all safety conditions met)"
  - Show interactive prompt only if conditions not met
- [x] Add get_skip_reason() helper function
  - Returns human-readable reason for skipping auto-resume
  - Examples: "Tests failing", "Plan modified", "Checkpoint 10 days old"
  - Display in interactive prompt

**Error Recovery Integration** (from 043 Phase 1):

  - Replace generic "Agent failed" with format_error_report()
  - Use detect_error_type() for test failure classification
  - Use generate_suggestions() for actionable troubleshooting
  - Display recovery options via suggest_recovery()

Testing:
```bash
# Test smart auto-resume
# Create checkpoint with safe conditions → /implement → Should auto-resume silently
# Create stale checkpoint → /implement → Should show prompt with reason

# Test checkpoint schema
jq '.plan_modification_time' checkpoint.json  # Should return timestamp

# Test error recovery integration
.claude/tests/test_retry_integration.sh
.claude/tests/test_error_classification.sh

# Integration test with simulated failures
/implement test_plan.md  # Should show improved error UX

# Verify functions used
grep "Auto-resuming from Phase" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log
grep "retry_with_backoff" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log
grep "classify_error" .claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log
```

**Expected Impact**: 90% of resumes automatic (no prompt), 50% reduction in agent failures, consistent error handling

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Phase Execution (Medium-High) [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Enable 40-60% performance improvement using existing parse-phase-dependencies.sh
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Complexity**: 7/10 (High architectural complexity)

**Summary**: Transforms /implement from sequential to wave-based parallel execution. Introduces fundamental architectural changes including wave coordination, concurrent agent invocation, checkpoint schema extensions, and sophisticated result aggregation. This phase achieves 40-60% performance gains by executing independent phases concurrently while maintaining fail-fast error handling.

**Key Architecture Changes**:
- Wave-based execution model with state machine (11 states)
- Multiple Task tool invocations in single message for parallelism
- Extended checkpoint schema tracking wave state and results
- Inline result aggregation from parallel agents
- Race condition detection and mitigation

For detailed implementation specification, see [Phase 2 Details](phase_2_parallel_phase_execution.md)

---

### Phase 3: Automatic Debug Integration & Progress Dashboard (Medium-High)
**Objective**: Auto-invoke /debug on test failures and add visual progress dashboard
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS (Core features implemented, integration/testing pending)
**Complexity**: 8/10 (High integration and architectural complexity)
**Progress**: 6/16 tasks completed (37.5%)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Commit**: 7cdce27

**Summary**: Merges three substantial features into a cohesive testing and UX enhancement. Automatic /debug invocation eliminates "should I debug?" prompts by automatically invoking /debug on test failures and presenting user choices (r/c/s/a). Tiered error recovery integrates existing error-utils.sh functions for intelligent failure handling. Progress dashboard provides real-time ANSI-rendered visualization with Unicode box-drawing, terminal capability detection, and graceful fallback to PROGRESS markers.

**Key Architecture Changes**:
- 5-state automatic debug workflow (test failure → auto-debug → user choices → action → continuation)
- 4-level tiered error recovery using existing error-utils.sh
- ANSI terminal rendering with multi-layer compatibility detection
- User choice state machine (r/c/s/a options) with persistence across failures
- Extended checkpoint schema tracking debug reports and iteration counts

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ progress-dashboard.sh utility created (300+ lines)
- ✅ Step 3.3 replaced with comprehensive automatic debug workflow (287 lines)
- ✅ add_debugging_notes() helper function implemented
- ✅ 4-level tiered error recovery integrated
- ✅ Checkpoint schema extended to v1.2 with debug fields
- ✅ User choice state persistence (r/c/s/a workflow)

**Remaining Work**:
- ⬚ Dashboard integration into /implement command flow
- ⬚ Test suites (progress dashboard, auto-debug, recovery)
- ⬚ Documentation updates for new workflows
- ⬚ Integration testing and validation

For detailed implementation specification and task tracking, see [Phase 3 Details](phase_3_auto_debug_dashboard.md)

---

### Phase 4: Hybrid Complexity & Workflow Metrics (Medium)
**Objective**: Add agent-based complexity evaluation and workflow metrics aggregation
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Progress**: 11/11 tasks completed (100%)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Complexity**: 7/10 (Architectural significance and implementation uncertainty)

**Summary**: Enhances complexity evaluation with hybrid approach combining proven threshold-based scoring with intelligent agent analysis for borderline cases. Adds workflow metrics aggregation to collect performance data across implementations. Agent-based evaluation invoked only for borderline complexity (score >=7 or tasks >=8), with score reconciliation algorithm choosing between threshold, agent, or averaged scores based on confidence. Workflow metrics aggregate data from logs and agent registry to generate actionable performance reports.

**Key Architecture Changes**:
- Hybrid complexity evaluation decision tree (when to invoke agent vs threshold-only)
- Score reconciliation algorithm with 4 decision paths (diff <2, >=2 + high/medium/low confidence)
- Agent invocation with 60-second timeout and immediate threshold fallback
- Workflow metrics collection from adaptive-planning.log and agent-registry.json
- Step 1.5 insertion in implement.md workflow (before proactive expansion)
- Complexity discrepancy logging for threshold accuracy improvement

For detailed implementation specification, see [Phase 4 Details](phase_4_hybrid_complexity_workflow_metrics.md)

- jq (for JSON parsing)
- git (for version control)
- grep, sed, awk (for text processing)

### Optional Tools
- bats (for enhanced unit testing)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk: Utility Integration Breaking Changes
**Risk**: Sourcing utilities could break existing inline logic

**Mitigation**:
- Phase 0 dedicated to integration with comprehensive testing
- Verify no regressions before proceeding to other phases
- Maintain backups of original command implementations
- Gradual replacement of inline logic (one function at a time)
- Extensive integration testing

### Medium-Risk: Parallel Phase Execution
**Risk**: Race conditions, result aggregation bugs

**Mitigation**:
- Leverage mature parse-phase-dependencies.sh (already battle-tested)
- Inline aggregation logic kept simple (no complex parallel-executor.sh)
- Comprehensive logging of parallel operations
- --sequential flag to disable parallelization
- Fail-fast behavior limits blast radius

### Medium-Risk: Progress Dashboard Terminal Compatibility
**Risk**: ANSI handling breaks on different terminals

**Mitigation**:
- Detect terminal capabilities before using ANSI
- Graceful fallback to traditional PROGRESS markers
- Test on common terminals (bash, zsh, fish, tmux, screen)
- Dashboard opt-in via --dashboard flag
- Document known terminal limitations

### Low-Risk: Effort Estimation
**Risk**: Integration might take longer than anticipated

**Mitigation**:
- Utilities already exist and are well-documented
- Integration pattern is straightforward (source + replace)
- Phase 0 provides early validation of integration approach
- Each phase can proceed independently if needed

## Performance Targets
