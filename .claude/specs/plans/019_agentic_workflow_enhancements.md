```

### New Components

1. **specs/artifacts/** - Intermediate research outputs directory
2. **.claude/learning/** - Adaptive learning data storage
3. **.claude/data/checkpoints/** - Workflow state persistence
4. **.claude/templates/** - Reusable workflow templates
5. **.claude/agents/agent-registry.json** - Agent performance metrics

### Key Patterns

- **Artifact References**: Lightweight IDs instead of full content
- **Extended Thinking**: Complexity-based thinking mode selection
- **Retry Logic**: 3-tier error recovery (retry → fallback → degrade)
- **Checkpointing**: Save state at phase boundaries
- **Streaming**: Real-time progress updates during long operations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes and Foundation [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Fix broken metrics system and add high-impact coordination improvements
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Effort**: 9 hours
**Priority**: Critical

Tasks:
- [x] Fix metrics collection in `.claude/hooks/post-command-metrics.sh`
  - Parse JSON from stdin when env vars missing
  - Add enhanced metric fields (phase, files_modified, tests_run, agent_count)
  - Test with multiple commands to verify 100% capture
- [x] Add extended thinking mode integration
  - Update `/orchestrate` with complexity analysis logic
  - Add thinking mode to `/plan`, `/implement`, `/debug` commands
  - Document thinking mode usage in command READMEs
- [x] Implement basic retry logic for agents
  - Add retry policy to agent definitions (3 retries with exponential backoff)
  - Update `research-specialist`, `code-writer`, `test-specialist`
  - Add fallback strategies for common failures (network, file access, timeout)
- [x] Create `specs/artifacts/` directory structure
  - Add README.md explaining artifact system
  - Update .gitignore if needed

Testing:
```bash
# Test metrics collection
# Run various commands and verify metrics capture
cat .claude/data/metrics/2025-10.jsonl | jq '.operation' | grep -v "unknown" | wc -l

# Test extended thinking
# Verify commands include thinking mode in agent prompts
grep -r "think hard" .claude/commands/

# Test retry logic
# Simulate transient failure and verify retry behavior
```

Expected Outcomes:
- 100% metric capture (vs. 9% currently)
- 20-40% better solution quality from extended thinking
- 30-50% fewer transient failures from retry logic

### Phase 2: Artifact System and Observability

**Objective**: Implement full artifact reference system and agent performance tracking
**Complexity**: Medium
**Effort**: 18 hours
**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ Complete → [Plan 020](020_artifact_system_and_observability.md)

**Summary**:
Phase 2 implements the artifact reference system to reduce context bloat and adds comprehensive agent performance tracking. Due to the complexity and scope of this phase, it has been broken down into a detailed 4-sub-phase implementation plan.

**Key Components**:
- **Artifact Reference System**: Store research outputs as artifacts, pass lightweight references instead of full content (60-80% context reduction)
- **Agent Performance Tracking**: SubagentStop hook, agent-registry.json, automatic metrics collection
- **Performance Analysis**: `/analyze-agents` command for actionable insights and optimization recommendations
- **Cross-Referencing**: Reports, plans, and summaries can reference artifacts to avoid duplication

**Implementation Plan**: See [020_artifact_system_and_observability.md](020_artifact_system_and_observability.md) for detailed sub-phases:
- Phase 2.1: Artifact Registry Foundation (4 hours)
- Phase 2.2: Artifact Reference System in Orchestrate (6 hours)

**Summary**:
Phase 3 implements workflow checkpointing for interruption recovery and enhanced error messages with fix suggestions. Due to the complexity of checkpoint management and error analysis, this phase has been broken down into a detailed 4-sub-phase implementation plan.

**Key Components**:
- **Workflow Checkpointing**: Save/restore workflow state at key points, interactive resume prompts, auto-cleanup policy
- **Checkpoint Integration**: Add to `/orchestrate` and `/implement` commands, enable seamless resume after interruption
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Parse errors intelligently, provide 2-3 specific fix suggestions, include debug commands and documentation links
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle partial failures, document what succeeded, suggest manual completion steps

**Implementation Plan**: See [021_workflow_resilience_error_handling.md](021_workflow_resilience_error_handling.md) for detailed sub-phases:
- Phase 3.1: Workflow Checkpointing Infrastructure (8 hours)

## Dependencies

### External
- None (all changes use existing tools and infrastructure)

### Internal
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (artifact system needs directory structure)
- Phase 3 can run in parallel with Phase 2
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 2 (uses artifact system)
- Phase 5 depends on Phases 1-4 (builds on all previous improvements)

### Execution Order
1. Phase 1 (critical fixes, foundation) - MUST run first
2. Phase 2 + Phase 3 (can run in parallel)
3. Phase 4 (depends on Phase 2)
4. Phase 5 (depends on all previous)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Phases 1, 2)
- Additive features, no breaking changes
- Easy to test incrementally
- Can be disabled if issues arise

### Medium Risk (Phases 3, 4)
- Changes core behavior (checkpointing, parallelization)
- Requires thorough testing
- Feature flags recommended for gradual rollout

### High Risk (Phase 5)
- Complex systems (learning, collaboration)
- Potential for unexpected interactions
- Prototype in separate branch first
- Extensive testing before merge

## Rollback Strategy

### Per-Feature Rollback
- Each improvement is independent
- Can disable via feature flags or config
- Revert specific commits if needed

### Phase Rollback
- Roll back entire phase if critical issues
- Each phase is in separate commits
- Test previous phase still works

### Full Rollback
- Keep backup of working system
- Revert all changes if needed
- Document lessons learned

## Notes

### Implementation Order Rationale
- Phase 1: Critical fixes that improve system immediately
- Phase 2-3: High-value improvements with manageable risk
- Phase 4: Efficiency gains that build on foundation
- Phase 5: Advanced features requiring stable base

### Complexity Estimates
- **Low**: 2-4 hours per task
- **Medium**: 4-8 hours per task
- **High**: 8-16 hours per task
- **Phase totals**: Include testing, documentation, buffer

### Success Metrics
Track these metrics before and after implementation:
- Metric capture rate (currently 9%, target 100%)
- Average workflow duration (target 30-50% reduction)
- Context size per agent invocation (target 60-80% reduction)
- Transient failure rate (target 30-50% reduction)
- Agent success rate by type (track all, improve underperformers)
- User satisfaction (qualitative feedback)

### Future Enhancements (Post-Plan)
These improvements were considered but deferred:
- MCP server integration for external tools
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Cloud-based learning synchronization
- Advanced visualization dashboards
