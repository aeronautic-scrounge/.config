## Technical Design

### Dynamic Agent Selection

```
Current (Static Selection):          Enhanced (Dynamic Selection):
┌──────────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ /implement always    │            │ Analyze phase type       │
│ executes directly    │            │ ↓                        │
│                      │   ───>     │ Score complexity (0-10)  │
│ No agent delegation  │            │ ↓                        │
│                      │            │ Select optimal agent:    │
│                      │            │ - doc → doc-writer       │
│                      │            │ - test → test-specialist │
│                      │            │ - code → code-writer     │
│                      │            │ - complex → with think   │
└──────────────────────┘            └──────────────────────────┘
```

### Complexity Scoring Algorithm

```
Phase Complexity Score (0-10):

score = 0
score += count_keywords(phase_name, ["refactor", "architecture"]) * 3
score += count_keywords(phase_name, ["implement", "create"]) * 2
score += count_keywords(phase_name, ["fix", "update"]) * 1
score += count_keywords(tasks, ["test", "verify"]) * 0.5
score += estimated_file_count * 0.5
score += (task_count / 5)

Agent Selection:
- score 0-2: Direct execution (simple tasks)
- score 3-5: code-writer agent
- score 6-7: code-writer + "think"
- score 8-9: code-writer + "think hard"
- score 10+: code-writer + "think harder"

Special Cases:
- "documentation" or "README" in name → doc-writer
- "test" in name → test-specialist
- "debug" or "investigate" in name → debug-assistant
```

### Progress Streaming Protocol

```
Agent Output Format:

Normal output:
<output line>

Progress marker:
PROGRESS: <progress-message>

Example from research-specialist:
PROGRESS: Searching for existing auth implementations...
PROGRESS: Found 15 files, analyzing patterns...
PROGRESS: Reviewing security best practices...
PROGRESS: Generating summary report...
```

### Intelligent Parallelization

```
Plan Phase Dependencies:

### Phase 1: Setup
dependencies: []

### Phase 2: Core Module A
dependencies: [1]

### Phase 3: Core Module B
dependencies: [1]

### Phase 4: Integration
dependencies: [2, 3]

Execution Flow:
Phase 1 ────┬──> Phase 2 ──┐
            └──> Phase 3 ──┴──> Phase 4

Parallel: Phases 2 and 3 run simultaneously
Sequential: Phase 4 waits for both 2 and 3
```

  - Verify backward compatibility

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test complexity scoring with various phase descriptions
- Test dependency graph builder with different DAGs
- Test progress marker parsing

### Integration Testing
- Test `/implement` with dynamic agent selection
- Test `/orchestrate` with progress streaming
- Test parallel execution with dependency plan
- Test `/plan-wizard` end-to-end flow

### Performance Testing
- Measure execution time before/after agent selection
- Measure parallel execution speedup
- Verify progress streaming overhead < 50ms
- Compare wizard plans to manually created plans

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing plans without dependencies work sequentially
- Plans without PROGRESS markers work normally
- Simple phases still execute directly

## Documentation Requirements

### New Documentation Files
- [ ] `.claude/docs/efficiency-guide.md`
  - Dynamic agent selection
  - Progress streaming usage
  - Parallel execution patterns
  - Plan wizard walkthrough

- [ ] `.claude/docs/plan-parallelization.md`
  - Dependency syntax
  - Common patterns
  - Performance best practices
  - Troubleshooting

### Updated Documentation
- [ ] `.claude/commands/implement.md`
  - Document agent selection behavior
  - Add parallelization section
  - Update phase format with dependencies

- [ ] `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`
  - Document progress streaming
  - Add progress display examples

- [ ] `.claude/commands/README.md`
  - Add `/plan-wizard` entry
  - Update `/implement` description

- [ ] Plan template updates
  - Add dependency field to phase format
  - Include dependency examples
  - Document optional nature

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Requires Phases 1-3 completion
- Builds on existing `/implement` and `/orchestrate`
- Uses existing agent system

### External
- None (all using existing infrastructure)

### Execution Order
- Must complete phases 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4 sequentially
- 4.2 (progress) could partially overlap with 4.1
- 4.4 (wizard) could partially overlap with 4.3

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Components
- Parallel execution (race conditions, deadlocks)
- Dynamic agent selection (incorrect agent choices)
- Progress streaming (output interference)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Limit max parallel phases to 3
- Test agent selection extensively
- Separate progress from normal output streams
- Extensive integration testing

### Rollback Plan
- Agent selection can be disabled via feature flag
- Parallelization disabled for plans without dependencies
- Progress streaming degrades gracefully if not supported
- Plan wizard is additive (doesn't affect existing commands)

## Notes

### Design Decisions

**Agent Selection Threshold**: score >= 3 delegates to agent
- Avoids overhead for trivial tasks
- Balances automation with performance
- Can be tuned based on experience

**Progress Marker Format**: `PROGRESS: <message>`
- Simple, grep-able format
- Easy for agents to emit
- Clear separation from normal output
- No complex parsing required

**Dependency Format**: Array of phase numbers `[1, 2]`
- Simple, readable syntax
- Easy to parse and validate
- Familiar to developers (like package.json)
- Allows referencing phases by number

**Max Parallel Phases**: 3
- Balances speedup vs. system load
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Can be increased for powerful systems
- Configurable via environment variable

### Future Enhancements (Post-Plan)
- Machine learning for agent selection
- Adaptive parallelization (auto-detect dependencies)
- Visual progress dashboard
- Plan wizard templates (common feature types)
- Agent selection override flags
- Parallel execution profiling
