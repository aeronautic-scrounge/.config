# /orchestrate Command Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration command for Claude Code
- **Scope**: End-to-end development workflows with intelligent parallelization and context preservation
- **Estimated Phases**: 5 phases
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**: [/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/reports/011_orchestrate_command_best_practices.md]

## Overview

This plan implements the `/orchestrate` command that coordinates multiple subagents through complete development workflows (research → planning → implementation → testing → documentation). The implementation follows the supervisor pattern with context-aware delegation, validated by 2025 industry research showing ~50% performance improvements through proper context management.

### Key Objectives

1. **Workflow Coordination**: Orchestrate research, planning, implementation, debugging, and documentation phases
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain minimal orchestrator state (<30% context usage) while providing comprehensive subagent context
3. **Intelligent Parallelization**: Automatically identify and execute parallelizable tasks with 60%+ time savings
4. **Robust Error Recovery**: Multi-level error detection with checkpoint-based recovery (90%+ success rate)
5. **Seamless Integration**: Natural coordination with existing 18-command ecosystem

### Architecture Principles

**Supervisor Pattern** (LangChain 2025):
- Centralized coordination with minimal state retention
- Specialized subagents with focused responsibilities
- Context isolation for each worker agent
- Forward message pattern to avoid paraphrasing errors

**Context Management**:
- Orchestrator: Workflow state, checkpoints, high-level decisions only
- Subagents: Complete task descriptions with necessary context
- No routing logic passed to subagents
- Structured handoffs with explicit success criteria

**Error Recovery**:
- Automatic retry with adjusted parameters (3 max)
- Checkpoint-based rollback and resume
- Graceful degradation to sequential execution
- Manual intervention points for critical failures

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully orchestrate research → plan → implement → document workflows
- [ ] Intelligent parallelization achieving ≥60% time savings on parallelizable tasks
- [ ] Context preservation with orchestrator using <30% of main agent context
- [ ] Error recovery success rate ≥90% for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Seamless integration with all 18 existing commands
- [ ] Workflow completion success rate ≥95% for standard patterns
- [ ] Documentation cross-referencing accuracy 100%

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Supervisor Pattern**: Validated by 2025 research showing 50% performance improvement through proper context management. Provides centralized coordination while maintaining worker specialization.

**Why Task Tool**: Native Claude Code mechanism for subagent invocation with isolated context windows. Supports both sequential and parallel execution patterns.

**Why Checkpoint-Based Recovery**: Enables workflow resume after interruptions and provides rollback capability for error recovery. Industry standard for long-running orchestrated workflows.

**Why Minimal State Retention**: LangChain 2025 research shows context clutter has "outsized impacts on agent reliability." Storing only essential state keeps orchestrator focused and performant.

### Implementation Order Rationale

1. **Foundation First**: Establish command structure and basic coordination before complexity
2. **Research Phase Early**: Validates parallel execution and context minimization patterns
3. **Core Workflow Middle**: Planning and implementation are the primary value proposition
4. **Error Recovery Late**: Requires stable core workflow to test effectively
5. **Documentation Last**: Needs complete workflow to generate comprehensive summaries

### Future Enhancements

- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined workflows for common patterns (feature, refactor, bug fix)
- **Learning-Based Optimization**: Track workflow patterns and optimize task distribution
- **Performance Dashboard**: Visual representation of orchestration metrics
- **Adaptive Complexity Scoring**: Dynamic workflow branching based on task complexity
- **Multi-Project Orchestration**: Coordinate workflows across related repositories

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Approach 1: Fully Autonomous Agents**
- Rejected: Less control, higher context usage, harder to debug
- Trade-off: More automation vs reliability and predictability

**Approach 2: Sequential-Only Execution**
- Rejected: Misses significant parallelization opportunities
- Trade-off: Simplicity vs performance

**Approach 3: External Workflow Engine**
- Rejected: Adds complexity, requires additional infrastructure
- Trade-off: More features vs simplicity and native integration

### Success Metrics Tracking

Track in workflow summaries:
- Total workflow execution time
- Phase breakdown times
- Parallelization effectiveness (actual vs potential savings)
- Error count and recovery success rate
- Context usage per phase
- User intervention frequency
