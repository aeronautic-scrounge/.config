# Enhanced /orchestrate Command Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Feature**: Enhanced /orchestrate command following industry best practices
- **Scope**: Implement practical orchestration solution with script generation, state management, and enhanced workflow guidance
- **Estimated Phases**: 4
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/reports/006_orchestrate_command_implementation_challenges.md

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive research in the implementation challenges report, this plan implements an enhanced `/orchestrate` command that works within the constraints of the Claude Code template system while providing maximum practical value. The solution combines intelligent workflow analysis with executable script generation, following industry best practices for workflow orchestration.

This implementation addresses the key limitation identified in the research: the inability to dynamically execute slash commands from within templates. Instead, it provides a hybrid approach that delivers both expert workflow analysis and practical automation through generated scripts.

   - Mitigation: Atomic state updates, backup mechanisms, validation checks

3. **Performance with Large Workflows**: Complex workflows may be slow to analyze
   - Mitigation: Performance optimization, caching, parallel processing

### Security Considerations
- Generated scripts must be safe and not expose sensitive information
- State files should not contain credentials or sensitive data
- Script execution should be sandboxed and validated

### Compatibility Concerns
- Ensure compatibility with existing Claude Code command interface
- Maintain backward compatibility with current `/orchestrate` usage
- Handle edge cases in workflow description parsing

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: Successfully generates and executes workflows for 95% of test cases
2. **Reliability**: Less than 5% failure rate in workflow execution
3. **Performance**: Analysis completes within 10 seconds for complex workflows
