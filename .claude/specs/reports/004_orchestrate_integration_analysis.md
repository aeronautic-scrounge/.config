## Executive Summary

This report provides comprehensive analysis of the existing command ecosystem to identify modifications and new helper commands needed to support the `/orchestrate` command. The research reveals that while the current 18-command system provides an excellent foundation, strategic enhancements are needed to enable sophisticated workflow orchestration.

**Key Findings:**
- **Strong Foundation**: Existing commands already demonstrate workflow patterns suitable for orchestration
- **Proven Capabilities**: The `/subagents` command provides validated parallel execution foundation
- **Clear Dependencies**: Well-established command dependency chains can be automated effectively
- **Missing Infrastructure**: Resource management, event-driven coordination, and cross-workflow communication need development

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- **4 critical command modifications** to existing commands for orchestration support
- **8 new helper commands** to provide essential orchestration infrastructure
- **Event-driven communication system** for real-time workflow coordination
- **Phased implementation approach** maintaining backward compatibility while adding orchestration capabilities

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Command Ecosystem Overview

The current command system demonstrates sophisticated workflow patterns with 18 commands organized into clear categories:

**Primary Commands (8)**: Core user-facing commands
- `setup`, `plan`, `implement`, `report`, `debug`, `refactor`, `cleanup`, `document`

**Dependent Commands (9)**: Supporting and utility commands
- `validate-setup`, `list-plans`, `list-reports`, `list-summaries`, `update-plan`, `update-report`, `revise`, `test`, `test-all`

**Utility Commands (1)**: Specialized coordination commands
- `subagents` (parallel task execution)

### Existing Workflow Patterns

#### Well-Established Dependency Chains
```
Research Workflow:
report → plan → implement → test → document

Debug Workflow:
debug → plan → implement → test → document

Maintenance Workflow:
refactor → plan → implement → test → document

Setup Workflow:
setup → validate-setup → [ready for workflows]
```

#### Current Integration Strengths
1. **Consistent YAML Structure**: All commands follow standardized frontmatter patterns
2. **Dependency Management**: Clear `dependent-commands` relationships
3. **Specs Integration**: Established cross-linking between reports, plans, and summaries
4. **Parallel Execution**: Proven `/subagents` utility for task-level parallelization

#### Identified Integration Gaps
1. **Cross-Workflow Coordination**: No mechanism for managing multiple concurrent workflows
2. **Resource Management**: No centralized resource allocation or conflict prevention
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Limited visibility into workflow progress and status
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Commands operate in isolation without event coordination
5. **Workflow State Management**: No persistent workflow state across command invocations
