2. ✅ **Artifact-based communication** via specs/ directory system
3. ✅ **Memory isolation** - each agent has focused tool access and responsibilities
4. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - 10 doc files, clear READMEs at every level
5. ✅ **SPECS.md registry** for multi-project support (recently implemented)
6. ✅ **Metrics collection** infrastructure for performance analysis

### Priority Improvement Areas

**Category A: Agent Coordination (High Impact)**
1. Implement extended thinking mode integration ("think harder" pattern)
2. Add artifact references instead of full context passing
3. Enhance error recovery with retry logic and fallback strategies

**Category B: Observability & Learning (Medium-High Impact)**
4. Fix metrics collection (91% unknown operations)
5. Add agent performance tracking and optimization
6. Implement conversation/workflow checkpointing

**Category C: Workflow Efficiency (Medium Impact)**
7. Add dynamic agent selection based on task complexity
8. Implement streaming progress updates during long operations

- Metrics system is underdeveloped (only 9% successful operation capture)
- Hook system is minimal but functional

## Detailed Improvement Recommendations

---

### Category A: Agent Coordination

#### 1. Extended Thinking Mode Integration

**Problem**: Complex tasks don't leverage Claude's extended thinking capabilities, leading to suboptimal solutions for difficult problems.

**2025 Best Practice**: Use "think", "think hard", "think harder", "ultrathink" to trigger increasing computation budgets for complex reasoning tasks.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## In /orchestrate command (orchestrate.md)

### Step 2.5: Determine Thinking Budget

Analyze workflow complexity to set thinking mode:

Complexity Indicators:
- **Simple**: Direct implementation, well-known patterns → No special thinking
- **Medium**: Multiple components, design decisions → "think" mode
- **Complex**: Architecture changes, novel solutions → "think hard" mode
- **Critical**: System-wide impact, security concerns → "think harder" mode

Agent Prompt Enhancement:
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "plan-architect"
  prompt: "
    **Thinking Mode**: think hard

    # Plan Task: [Complex Feature]
    [Rest of existing prompt...]
  "
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 20-40% better solution quality for complex tasks
- Reduced need for revision cycles
- Better architecture decisions upfront

**Costs**:
- Increased token usage for complex tasks (acceptable trade-off)
- Slightly longer response times (offset by fewer revisions)

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Low (2-3 hours to update commands)
**Impact**: High

---

#### 2. Artifact Reference System

**Problem**: Full context passed to subagents causes token bloat and context pollution, especially in `/orchestrate` workflows with multiple research agents.

**2025 Best Practice**: Pass lightweight artifact references instead of full content, allowing agents to retrieve only what they need.

**Current Pattern**:
```markdown
# Research Phase aggregation passes full summaries
research_summary: "
  Agent 1 findings: [150 words]
  Agent 2 findings: [150 words]
  Agent 3 findings: [150 words]
  Total: 450 words passed to plan-architect
"
```

**Improved Pattern**:
```markdown
# Store research outputs as artifacts in specs/artifacts/
artifact_registry:
  research_001: specs/artifacts/auth_system/existing_patterns.md
  research_002: specs/artifacts/auth_system/best_practices.md
  research_003: specs/artifacts/auth_system/alternatives.md

# Pass only references to plan-architect
Agent Prompt:
  "Research artifacts available:
   - Existing patterns: Read research_001 if needed
   - Best practices: Read research_002 if needed
   - Alternatives: Read research_003 if needed

   Create plan incorporating relevant research findings."
```

**Artifact Directory Structure**:
```
specs/
├── artifacts/           # Intermediate research outputs, cached data
│   ├── auth_system/    # Project-specific artifacts
│   │   ├── existing_patterns.md
│   │   ├── best_practices.md
│   │   └── alternatives.md
│   └── payment_flow/
│       └── api_research.md
├── reports/            # Final research reports (can reference artifacts)
│   ├── 023_auth_analysis.md    # References artifacts/auth_system/*
│   └── 024_payment_design.md   # References artifacts/payment_flow/*
├── plans/              # Implementation plans (can reference artifacts)
│   └── 019_auth_impl.md        # References artifacts/auth_system/*
└── summaries/          # Implementation summaries
    └── 019_summary.md
```

**Implementation**:
1. Create `specs/artifacts/` directory structure
2. Update `/orchestrate` to store intermediate research as artifacts under `specs/artifacts/project_name/`
3. Update agent prompts to reference artifacts by ID or path
4. Add artifact resolution in agent definitions
5. Allow reports, plans, and summaries to reference artifacts to avoid duplication

**Artifact Organization**:
- **Naming**: `specs/artifacts/{project_name}/{artifact_name}.md`
- **Project Name**: Derived from feature/workflow description (e.g., "auth_system", "payment_flow")
- **Lifecycle**: Artifacts persist after workflow completion for future reference
- **Cross-referencing**: Reports can link to artifacts instead of duplicating content

**Benefits**:
- 60-80% reduction in context size for multi-agent workflows
- Prevents information loss from summarization
- Enables selective detail retrieval
- Keeps specs/reports/ clean and focused on final outputs
- Artifacts can be reused across multiple plans/reports
- Clear separation between intermediate (artifacts) and final (reports) outputs

**Costs**:
- More file I/O operations (minimal performance impact)
- Additional complexity in orchestration logic
- New directory structure to maintain

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (8-12 hours across orchestrate + agents)
**Impact**: High

---

#### 3. Retry Logic and Fallback Strategies

**Problem**: Agents fail permanently on transient errors (network issues, temporary file locks, etc.) without retry attempts.

**2025 Best Practice**: Multi-level error handling with retries, fallbacks, and graceful degradation.

**Implementation**:

Add to agent definitions (example for research-specialist.md):

```markdown
## Error Handling Strategy

### Retry Policy
- **Network Errors**: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **File Access Errors**: 2 retries with 500ms delay
- **Search Timeouts**: 1 retry with broader search terms

### Fallback Strategies
1. **Web Search Fails**: Fall back to codebase-only research
2. **Grep Timeout**: Fall back to Glob + targeted Read
3. **Complex Search**: Fall back to simpler search pattern

### Graceful Degradation
- Partial results are better than no results
- Document limitations in output
- Suggest manual investigation for failed components
```

Add to commands (example for /orchestrate):

```markdown
### Error Recovery Loop

If subagent fails:
1. **Analyze Error**: Check error type (transient vs permanent)
2. **Retry Decision**: Transient → retry, Permanent → fallback
3. **Fallback Selection**: Choose alternative approach
4. **Documentation**: Log error and recovery in workflow state
5. **Continue**: Proceed with best available information
```

**Benefits**:
- 30-50% reduction in workflow failures
- Better resilience to environmental issues
- Improved user experience (less manual intervention)

**Costs**:
- Increased execution time for failed operations (acceptable)
- More complex error handling code

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium-High (12-16 hours across all agents)
**Impact**: High

---

### Category B: Observability & Learning

#### 4. Fix Metrics Collection System

**Problem**: Current metrics show 91% "unknown" operations, making performance analysis impossible.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```json
// Current output (broken)
{"timestamp":"2025-10-01T18:00:39Z","operation":"unknown","duration_ms":0,"status":"unknown"}

// Expected output
{"timestamp":"2025-10-01T18:00:39Z","operation":"implement","duration_ms":45230,"status":"success"}
```

**Issue**: `$CLAUDE_COMMAND`, `$CLAUDE_DURATION_MS`, `$CLAUDE_STATUS` environment variables not being set or passed correctly to hook.

**Fix**:

Update `.claude/hooks/post-command-metrics.sh`:

```bash
# Current (broken)
COMMAND="${CLAUDE_COMMAND:-unknown}"
DURATION="${CLAUDE_DURATION_MS:-0}"
STATUS="${CLAUDE_STATUS:-unknown}"

# Enhanced (with fallback detection)
# Try standard env vars first
COMMAND="${CLAUDE_COMMAND:-}"

# Fallback: Parse from stdin JSON if env vars missing
if [ -z "$COMMAND" ]; then
  # Stop hook receives JSON event on stdin
  EVENT_JSON=$(cat)
  COMMAND=$(echo "$EVENT_JSON" | jq -r '.command // "unknown"')
  DURATION=$(echo "$EVENT_JSON" | jq -r '.duration_ms // 0')
  STATUS=$(echo "$EVENT_JSON" | jq -r '.status // "unknown"')
else
  DURATION="${CLAUDE_DURATION_MS:-0}"
  STATUS="${CLAUDE_STATUS:-unknown}"
fi
```

Add enhanced metrics fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:23:45Z",
  "operation": "implement",
  "duration_ms": 45230,
  "status": "success",
  "phase": "implementation",
  "files_modified": 7,
  "tests_run": 15,
  "agent_count": 3,
  "token_estimate": 125000
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Actionable performance data for optimization
- Identify slow commands and bottlenecks
- Track agent efficiency over time

**Costs**:
- Minimal (1-2 hours to fix and enhance)

**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: High

---

#### 5. Agent Performance Tracking

**Problem**: No visibility into which agents are efficient vs. inefficient, preventing optimization.

**Implementation**:

Create `.claude/agents/agent-registry.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "code-writer": {
      "total_invocations": 45,
      "success_rate": 0.956,
      "avg_duration_ms": 8340,
      "avg_tokens": 3200,
      "last_failure": "2025-10-02T15:23:11Z",
      "efficiency_score": 0.89
    },
    "research-specialist": {
      "total_invocations": 78,
      "success_rate": 0.987,
      "avg_duration_ms": 12450,
      "avg_tokens": 2100,
      "last_failure": "2025-09-28T09:14:33Z",
      "efficiency_score": 0.94
    }
  }
}
```

Add SubagentStop hook to settings.local.json:

```json
"SubagentStop": [
  {
    "matcher": ".*",
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/post-subagent-metrics.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Create analytics command `/analyze-agents`:

```bash
# Show agent performance summary
/analyze-agents

# Output:
Agent Performance Report (Last 30 Days)
========================================

research-specialist:    ★★★★★ 94% efficiency, 98.7% success
code-writer:           ★★★★☆ 89% efficiency, 95.6% success
plan-architect:        ★★★★☆ 91% efficiency, 93.2% success
test-specialist:       ★★★☆☆ 76% efficiency, 88.1% success  [NEEDS ATTENTION]

Recommendations:
- test-specialist: Review timeout settings, increase to 300s
- code-writer: 4.4% failures due to syntax errors, improve validation
```

**Benefits**:
- Data-driven agent optimization
- Identify underperforming agents
- Track improvement over time

**Costs**:
- Storage overhead (minimal, <1MB/month)
- New hook + analytics command (8-10 hours)

**Priority**: Medium-High
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium-High

---

#### 6. Workflow Checkpointing

**Problem**: Long `/orchestrate` workflows can't be resumed if interrupted (context loss, wasted work).

**2025 Best Practice**: Save workflow state at phase boundaries, enable graceful resume.

**Implementation**:

Add to `/orchestrate` command:

```markdown
### Checkpoint System

After each phase completion:

1. **Save Workflow State**
   ```yaml
   # .claude/data/checkpoints/wf_<timestamp>.json
   {
     "workflow_id": "wf_20251003_142305",
     "description": "Implement user authentication system",
     "start_time": "2025-10-03T14:23:05Z",
     "current_phase": "implementation",
     "completed_phases": ["research", "planning"],
     "phase_artifacts": {
       "research": ["reports/026_auth_patterns.md", "reports/027_security_practices.md"],
       "planning": ["plans/019_auth_implementation.md"]
     },
     "context_summary": "Implementing session-based auth with bcrypt hashing...",
     "next_phase": "testing",
     "estimated_completion": "2025-10-03T16:45:00Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Resume Detection**
   When `/orchestrate` starts, check for recent incomplete checkpoints:
   ```
   Found incomplete workflow from 2 hours ago:
   "Implement user authentication system" (80% complete)

   Options:
   1. Resume from testing phase
   2. Start fresh workflow
   3. View checkpoint details

   Choice: _
   ```

3. **Cleanup Policy**
   - Delete checkpoints after successful completion
   - Archive failed workflows for debugging
   - Auto-cleanup checkpoints >7 days old
```

**Benefits**:
- Resume interrupted workflows seamlessly
- Prevent duplicate work
- Better progress visibility

**Costs**:
- Checkpoint storage (~5KB per workflow)
- Resume logic complexity

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (10-14 hours)
**Impact**: Medium-High

---

### Category C: Workflow Efficiency

#### 7. Dynamic Agent Selection

**Problem**: Commands always use same agent type regardless of task complexity. Simple tasks get heavy agents, complex tasks get lightweight agents.

**Current State**:
```markdown
# /implement always uses code-writer for all phases
# Even if phase is simple file rename or complex refactoring
```

**Improved State**:
```markdown
# /implement analyzes phase and selects appropriate agent

Phase Analysis:
- "Update README.md" → doc-writer (specialized, faster)
- "Refactor auth module" → code-writer with "think hard" mode
- "Add type annotations" → code-writer (standard mode)
- "Fix typo in comment" → Direct edit (no agent needed)
```

**Implementation**:

Add agent selection logic to `/implement`:

```markdown
### Step 2.5: Select Optimal Agent for Phase

Analyze phase tasks and select best agent:

```python
def select_agent(phase_tasks, complexity_score):
    if all(task.is_documentation() for task in phase_tasks):
        return "doc-writer"

    if complexity_score < 3:
        return "code-writer"  # Standard mode

    if complexity_score < 7:
        return "code-writer", {"thinking_mode": "think"}

    return "code-writer", {"thinking_mode": "think hard"}

def calculate_complexity(phase_tasks):
    score = 0
    score += len(phase_tasks) * 0.5
    score += count_files_affected(phase_tasks) * 1.0
    score += 3 if "refactor" in description.lower() else 0
    score += 2 if "architecture" in description.lower() else 0
    score += 2 if requires_testing(phase_tasks) else 0
    return min(score, 10)
```

**Benefits**:
- 15-30% faster execution for simple phases
- Better resource utilization
- Improved quality for complex phases

**Costs**:
- Selection logic complexity
- Risk of incorrect agent choice (mitigated by fallback)

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (6-8 hours)
**Impact**: Medium

---

#### 8. Streaming Progress Updates

**Problem**: Long operations (research, implementation) appear frozen with no progress indication.

**Current Experience**:
```
/orchestrate "Implement authentication system"

[Starting research phase...]
[20 seconds of silence]
[Agent completes]
Research complete.

[Starting implementation...]
[45 seconds of silence]
[Agent completes]
Implementation complete.
```

**Improved Experience**:
```
/orchestrate "Implement authentication system"

[Starting research phase...]
  → research-specialist: Searching codebase for auth patterns...
  → research-specialist: Found 12 existing auth implementations
  → research-specialist: Analyzing security best practices...
  → research-specialist: Comparing bcrypt vs argon2...
Research complete (3 reports generated).

[Starting implementation...]
  → code-writer: Creating auth/sessions.lua module...
  → code-writer: Implementing hash_password function...
  → code-writer: Adding session validation...
  → test-specialist: Running auth test suite...
  → test-specialist: 15/15 tests passing ✓
Implementation complete (7 files modified, 15 tests passing).
```

**Implementation**:

Requires agent-level progress reporting:

```markdown
# In agent definitions
## Progress Reporting

Agents should output progress markers during long operations:

```bash
echo "PROGRESS: Analyzing authentication patterns in codebase..."
# ... do work ...
echo "PROGRESS: Found 12 implementations, reviewing security..."
# ... do work ...
echo "PROGRESS: Finalizing recommendations..."
```

Orchestrate captures and displays these in real-time.
```

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience
- Confidence that system is working
- Early detection of stuck agents

**Costs**:
- Agent implementation complexity
- Potential noise for fast operations

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium-High (10-15 hours across all agents)
**Impact**: Medium (UX improvement)

---

#### 9. Intelligent Parallelization Hints

**Problem**: `/orchestrate` uses simple heuristics for parallelization. Complex dependencies aren't analyzed, leading to suboptimal execution.

**Current Logic**:
```markdown
# All research agents run in parallel (always)
# Implementation is always sequential (even if independent)
```

**Improved Logic**:

```markdown
### Dependency Analysis

Before launching agents, analyze task dependencies:

```yaml
# Example workflow dependency graph
tasks:
  - id: research_auth_patterns
    type: research
    dependencies: []

  - id: research_security
    type: research
    dependencies: []

  - id: create_plan
    type: planning
    dependencies: [research_auth_patterns, research_security]

  - id: implement_hashing
    type: implementation
    dependencies: [create_plan]

  - id: implement_sessions
    type: implementation
    dependencies: [create_plan]  # Independent of hashing!

  - id: integration_tests
    type: testing
    dependencies: [implement_hashing, implement_sessions]

# Execution schedule (optimal):
Phase 1 (parallel): research_auth_patterns, research_security
Phase 2 (sequential): create_plan
Phase 3 (parallel): implement_hashing, implement_sessions
Phase 4 (sequential): integration_tests
```

Reduces total time from sequential: 180s to optimized: 95s (47% faster)

**Implementation**:
- Add dependency field to plan phases
- Build dependency graph before execution
- Topologically sort to find parallelizable phases
- Execute with maximum safe parallelism

**Benefits**:
- 30-50% faster execution for complex workflows
- Optimal resource utilization
- Better user experience

**Costs**:
- Dependency analysis complexity
- Risk of incorrect dependency inference

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: High (15-20 hours)
**Impact**: Medium-High

---

### Category D: Developer Experience

#### 10. Interactive Plan Wizard

**Problem**: Creating comprehensive plans for complex features requires deep knowledge of system. New users struggle.

**Implementation**:

Create `/plan-wizard` command:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, TodoWrite
description: Interactive wizard for creating comprehensive implementation plans
---

# Plan Wizard

## Workflow

### Step 1: Feature Discovery
```
What feature are you implementing?
> User authentication system

What triggered this work? (Select one or more)
[ ] New feature request
[x] Security requirement

Plan saved. Run `/implement` when ready.
```

**Benefits**:
- Lower barrier to entry
- More comprehensive plans
- Guided best practices

**Costs**:
- Development effort (12-15 hours)
- Maintenance overhead

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium-High
**Impact**: Medium (mainly for less experienced users)

---

#### 11. Workflow Templates

**Problem**: Common patterns (CRUD feature, API endpoint, refactoring) are reimplemented from scratch each time.

**Implementation**:

Create `.claude/templates/` directory:

```
.claude/templates/
├── crud-feature/
│   ├── template.yaml
│   ├── plan-template.md
│   └── research-queries.txt
├── api-endpoint/
│   ├── template.yaml
│   ├── plan-template.md
│   └── test-template.md
└── refactoring/
    ├── template.yaml
    └── plan-template.md
```

Example template.yaml:

```yaml
name: "CRUD Feature Implementation"
description: "Create a new CRUD feature with database, API, and tests"
phases:
  - research:
      topics:
        - "Existing CRUD patterns in codebase"
        - "Database schema conventions"
  - planning:
      sections:
        - "Database schema design"
        - "API endpoint specification"
        - "Test coverage requirements"
  - implementation:
      phases:
        - "Create database migration"
        - "Implement model layer"
        - "Create API endpoints"
        - "Add validation"
        - "Write tests"
  - testing:
      types: ["unit", "integration", "e2e"]
  - documentation:
      files: ["README.md", "API.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]

variables:
  - name: "resource_name"
    prompt: "Resource name (singular, e.g., 'user'):"
  - name: "fields"
    prompt: "Fields (comma-separated):"
```

Add `/plan-from-template` command:

```bash
/plan-from-template crud-feature

Resource name (singular): post
Fields (comma-separated): title, body, author_id, published_at

Generating plan from template...
Created: specs/plans/020_post_crud_feature.md
```

**Benefits**:
- 60-80% faster plan creation for common patterns
- Consistent approach across features
- Captures institutional knowledge

**Costs**:
- Template creation and maintenance
- Template storage (~50KB per template)

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium (10-14 hours including templates)
**Impact**: Medium

---

#### 12. Enhanced Error Messages

**Problem**: Error messages are technical and don't suggest solutions.

**Current Error**:
```
Error: Failed to run tests
Command: :TestSuite
Exit code: 1
```

**Enhanced Error**:
```
Error: Test suite failed (auth/session_spec.lua)

Root Cause:
  Session timeout test failed - expected 3600s, got 7200s

Suggested Fixes:
  1. Update test expectation to match new timeout value
     File: tests/auth/session_spec.lua:45
     Change: expect(timeout).to.equal(3600) → expect(timeout).to.equal(7200)

  2. Revert timeout change if unintentional
     File: config/session.lua:12
     Check: SESSION_TIMEOUT = 7200

  3. Debug timeout calculation
     Run: /debug "Session timeout not matching expected value"

Next Steps:
  • Review commit history for timeout changes: git log -p config/session.lua
  • Check if 7200s is intentional per requirements
  • Update test or revert code change
```

**Implementation**:

Add error enhancement to all commands:

```markdown
### Error Enhancement

When error occurs:
1. Capture full error output
2. Parse error type and location
3. Search codebase for related context
4. Generate 2-3 specific fix suggestions
5. Provide debug commands for investigation
6. Include relevant documentation links
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster problem resolution
- Better learning experience
- Reduced frustration

**Costs**:
- Error analysis complexity
- Potential for incorrect suggestions

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: High (12-18 hours across all commands)
**Impact**: Medium-High

### Category E: Advanced Capabilities

#### 13. Agent Collaboration Patterns

**Problem**: Agents never directly collaborate. All coordination through orchestrator causes bottlenecks.

**2025 Best Practice**: Allow agents to request input from other agents for specialized subtasks.

**Current Pattern**:
```
Orchestrator → code-writer → [gets stuck on complex decision]
                            → returns incomplete
Orchestrator → [manually invoke research-specialist]
Orchestrator → code-writer (retry with research)
```

**Improved Pattern**:
```
Orchestrator → code-writer → [encounters complexity]
                           → code-writer requests research-specialist
                           → research-specialist provides input
                           → code-writer continues with informed decision
```

**Implementation**:

Add collaboration capability to agents:

```markdown
# In code-writer.md

## Agent Collaboration

When encountering decisions requiring specialized expertise:

```yaml
# Request research from research-specialist
REQUEST_AGENT: {
  "agent": "research-specialist",
  "task": "Analyze existing error handling patterns",
  "max_duration": "60s",
  "output_format": "150-word summary"
}

# Continue after receiving response
```

Benefits:
- Fewer orchestrator round-trips
- Faster decision-making
- Better quality with specialized input

Limitations:
- Maximum 1 collaboration per agent execution
- Only read-only agents can be requested (research, code-reviewer)
- Prevents infinite collaboration loops
```

**Benefits**:
- 40-60% reduction in round-trip latency
- More autonomous agents
- Better decision quality

**Costs**:
- Complexity of agent-to-agent communication
- Risk of collaboration loops (mitigated by limits)

**Priority**: Low-Medium
**Effort**: High (20-25 hours)
**Impact**: Medium

---

#### 14. Adaptive Learning System

**Problem**: System doesn't learn from past successes/failures to improve future executions.

**Implementation**:

Create `.claude/learning/` directory:

```
.claude/learning/
├── patterns.jsonl          # Successful patterns
├── antipatterns.jsonl      # Failed approaches
├── optimizations.jsonl     # Performance improvements
└── context-suggestions.json # Learned heuristics
```

Example learning entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:30:22Z",
  "pattern_type": "successful_implementation",
  "context": {
    "feature_type": "authentication",
    "complexity": "high",
    "approach": "session-based with bcrypt"
  },
  "outcome": {
    "success": true,
    "duration_ms": 45000,
    "test_pass_rate": 1.0,
    "review_score": 0.94
  },
  "learnings": {
    "optimal_agent_sequence": ["research-specialist", "plan-architect", "code-writer", "test-specialist"],
    "thinking_mode": "think hard",
    "key_success_factors": [
      "Thorough security research upfront",
      "Comprehensive test coverage",
      "Session timeout configuration"
    ]
  }
}
```

Adaptive system usage:

```markdown
# Before starting new workflow
/orchestrate "Implement OAuth integration"

# System checks learning database
Found similar past workflows:
  - "Implement authentication system" (95% success, Oct 2025)
  - "Add SSO support" (78% success, Sep 2025)

Recommendations based on past successes:
  ✓ Use research-specialist for security analysis (improved outcome by 23%)
  ✓ Set thinking mode to "think hard" for OAuth complexity
  ✓ Allocate 25% more time than estimated (past projects underestimated by 22%)
  ✓ Include security-team review checkpoint

Apply recommendations? [Y/n]: y
```

**Benefits**:
- Continuously improving performance
- Capture institutional knowledge
- Data-driven optimization

**Costs**:
- Learning storage (grows over time, ~1MB/month)
- Analysis overhead (minor, <1s per workflow)
- Privacy considerations (sensitive code patterns)

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Very High (30-40 hours for full system)
**Impact**: High (long-term compound value)

2. Metrics/observability (critical)
3. Full artifact system (high priority)
4. Adaptive learning (emerging practice)

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Complete Rewrite vs. Incremental Improvement

**Decision**: Incremental improvement
**Rationale**: Current system is solid foundation, rewrite too risky

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- ❌ Rewrite from scratch (too much working code to discard)
- ❌ Fork and experiment (splits maintenance effort)
- ✅ Incremental enhancement (preserves stability, gradual improvement)

---

### 2. Centralized vs. Distributed Metrics

**Decision**: Enhanced centralized (current approach)
**Rationale**: Simpler, easier to analyze, sufficient for single-user

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- ❌ Distributed metrics per agent (unnecessary complexity)
- ✅ Centralized with agent breakdown (best of both)

---

### 3. Monolithic vs. Modular Learning System

**Decision**: Modular learning (if implemented)
**Rationale**: Easier to disable components, lower risk

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- ❌ Monolithic learning engine (too complex)
- ❌ Cloud-based learning (privacy concerns)
- ✅ Local modular learning (privacy-preserving, flexible)

---
