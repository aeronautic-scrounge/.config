## Commits Analysis

### Commit 1: ecd9d0c (2025-10-16 14:02)
**Title**: "feat: Add plan hierarchy update integration to /implement command"
**File**: `.claude/commands/implement.md`
**Lines Changed**: +90, -3 (net +87 lines)

#### Changes Made

**Added Section**: "Plan Hierarchy Update After Phase Completion" (lines 184-269)

**Content Added**:
1. **Complete spec-updater agent invocation pattern** (87 lines)
   - When to update (after git commit, before checkpoint)
   - Update workflow with 4 steps
   - Complete Task invocation template
   - Validation steps
   - Error handling procedures
   - Checkpoint field additions (`hierarchy_updated`)

2. **Documentation of 3 hierarchy levels**:
   - Level 0: Single file (main plan only)
   - Level 1: Expanded phases (phase file + main plan)
   - Level 2: Stage expansion (stage → phase → main)

3. **Graceful degradation pattern**:
   ```bash
   source .claude/lib/checkbox-utils.sh
   mark_phase_complete "$PLAN_PATH" "$PHASE_NUM"
   verify_checkbox_consistency "$PLAN_PATH" "$PHASE_NUM"
   ```

**Quality Assessment**: ✅ HIGH QUALITY
- Complete, executable instructions (follows architecture standards)
- Inline agent prompt template (not truncated)
- Specific bash commands with parameters
- Clear error handling procedures
- Should be **PRESERVED** during restoration

## Preservation Strategy

When restoring executable instructions from commit 40b9146^, use this strategy to preserve improvements:

### Step 1: Restore Core Executable Instructions

For each damaged file (orchestrate.md, implement.md, revise.md, setup.md):

1. **Extract pre-damage content**:
   ```bash
   git show 40b9146^:.claude/commands/orchestrate.md > orchestrate_original.md
   git show 40b9146^:.claude/commands/implement.md > implement_original.md
   git show 40b9146^:.claude/commands/revise.md > revise_original.md
   git show 40b9146^:.claude/commands/setup.md > setup_original.md
   ```

2. **Identify sections to restore**:
   - Research Phase execution steps (orchestrate.md lines 414-550)
   - Planning Phase context structure (orchestrate.md lines 551-750)
   - Implementation Phase result parsing (orchestrate.md lines 751-1100)
   - Documentation Phase agent template (orchestrate.md lines 1101-1700)
   - Utility initialization (implement.md lines 160-300)
   - Phase execution protocol (implement.md lines 300-545)
   - Auto-mode JSON specification (revise.md lines 348-770)
   - Setup mode workflows (setup.md lines 22-225)

### Step 2: Merge Post-Damage Improvements

**For implement.md**:
1. Restore original lines 160-545 (execution protocols)
2. **KEEP** current lines 184-269 (Plan Hierarchy Update section from ecd9d0c)
3. Update example paths to topic-based structure (from e1d9054)
4. Add `hierarchy_updated` to checkpoint schema documentation

**For orchestrate.md**:
1. Restore original lines 414-1700 (Research, Planning, Implementation, Documentation phases)
2. **KEEP** current lines 772-843 (Plan Hierarchy Update section from 1d2ae25)
3. Update all example paths to topic-based structure (from e1d9054)
4. Preserve spec-updater integration in Documentation Phase

**For revise.md**:
1. Restore original lines 150-770 (Operation Modes, Auto-mode specification)
2. No post-damage improvements to preserve

**For setup.md**:
1. Restore original lines 22-225 (Mode workflows)
2. No post-damage improvements to preserve

### Step 3: Validation After Merge

Run all validation tests from command_architecture_standards.md:

```bash
# Test 1: Line count verification
wc -l .claude/commands/{orchestrate,implement,revise,setup}.md
# orchestrate.md should be ~2700+ lines (original 2720 + improvements)
# implement.md should be ~1000+ lines (original 987 + improvements)
# revise.md should be ~900 lines (original 878, no improvements)
# setup.md should be ~920 lines (original 911, no improvements)

# Test 2: Critical pattern presence
grep -c "Step [0-9]:" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md  # Should be ≥15
grep -c "CRITICAL:" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md    # Should be ≥3
grep -c "Task {" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md       # Should be ≥5

# Test 3: New improvements present
grep -q "Plan Hierarchy Update" .claude/commands/implement.md
grep -q "Plan Hierarchy Update" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md
grep -q "specs/.*_.*/.*/.*\.md" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md  # Topic-based paths
```
