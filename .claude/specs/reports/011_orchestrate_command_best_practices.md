## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes current best practices (2025) for designing an `/orchestrate` command that coordinates multiple subagents through complete development workflows while preserving context and minimizing token usage in the orchestrating agent. The research draws from industry leader patterns (Microsoft, AWS, LangChain), Claude Code architecture, and existing command ecosystem analysis.

**Key Finding**: The supervisor pattern with context-aware delegation, intelligent parallelization, and hierarchical error recovery provides the optimal architecture for workflow orchestration in Claude Code.

## Research Objectives

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Design patterns for research → planning → implementation → documentation workflows
2. **Context Preservation**: Strategies to maintain workflow coherence while minimizing orchestrator context usage
3. **Parallel Execution**: Intelligent task analysis and parallel subagent coordination
4. **Error Recovery**: Robust failure handling with checkpoint-based recovery
5. **Integration**: Seamless coordination with existing 18-command ecosystem

## Background and Context

### Current Claude Code Architecture

**Existing Command Ecosystem** (18 commands):
- **Primary Commands**: `setup`, `plan`, `implement`, `report`, `debug`, `refactor`, `test`, `document`, `cleanup`, `revise`
- **Dependent Commands**: `validate-setup`, `list-plans`, `list-reports`, `list-summaries`, `update-plan`, `update-report`, `test-all`, `resume-implement`
- **Utility Commands**: (none yet - opportunity for `/orchestrate`)

**Workflow Dependencies**:
```
setup → validate-setup
report → plan → implement → summaries
debug → plan → implement → test
refactor → plan → implement
list-* → update-* → revise
```

### Claude Code Subagent Capabilities

**Task Tool Features**:
- Launches specialized agents with specific tool permissions
- Each subagent operates in isolated context window
- Subagents can run in parallel when explicitly requested
- Results returned in single final message to parent agent
- Supports automatic and explicit delegation

**Subagent Types** (from documentation):
- `general-purpose` - Full tool access for complex multi-step tasks
- Custom types can be defined with specific tool restrictions

## Key Findings

### 1. Supervisor Agent Pattern (Industry Standard 2025)

#### Core Architecture
The supervisor pattern dominates multi-agent orchestration in 2025:
- **Centralized Coordination**: Single supervisor manages all task delegation
- **Specialized Workers**: Each subagent has focused responsibility
- **Context Isolation**: Workers operate in separate context windows
- **Result Aggregation**: Supervisor synthesizes worker outputs

#### Critical Best Practices (LangChain 2025 Benchmarking)

**Context Preservation Techniques**:
1. **Remove Handoff Messages from Sub-Agent State**: "De-clutters the sub-agent's context window and lets it perform its task better" - resulted in ~50% performance improvement
2. **Forward Message Tool**: Allow supervisor to pass sub-agent responses directly without paraphrasing - reduces translation errors
3. **Task-Focused Descriptions**: Include "all relevant context" in handoff descriptions, not routing logic
4. **Individual Scratchpads**: Each agent maintains its own working memory

**Supervisor Responsibilities**:
- Parse user requirements into workflow phases
- Break phases into independent tasks
- Select appropriate specialized agents
- Coordinate task sequencing and parallelization
- Aggregate and synthesize results
- Manage error recovery and retries

### 2. Context Preservation Strategies

#### Hierarchical Context Management

**Global Context** (Maintained by Orchestrator):
- Workflow state and phase tracking
- High-level decisions and rationale
- Error recovery checkpoints
- Cross-phase dependencies

**Phase Context** (Passed to Subagents):
- Specific task requirements
- Relevant prior phase outputs
- Success criteria and validation rules
- File paths and affected components

**Agent Context** (Isolated to Subagent):
- Task-specific research and analysis
- Detailed implementation work
- Test execution and results
- Documentation generation

#### Context Minimization Techniques

**For Orchestrator**:
```markdown
1. Delegate deep analysis to research subagents
2. Use planning subagents for detailed design
3. Employ implementation subagents for code changes
4. Summarize subagent results rather than storing full outputs
5. Store structured metadata, not full content
```

**For Subagents**:
```markdown
1. Provide focused, complete task descriptions
2. Include only necessary context from prior phases
3. Specify exact output format requirements
4. Remove orchestration routing logic
5. Use project standards (CLAUDE.md) for implicit context
```

### 3. Intelligent Parallel Execution

#### Task Analysis Framework

**Independence Scoring** (0-100 scale):
```yaml
High Independence (+20 to +30 points):
  - Create new files in different directories
  - Add standalone features
  - Implement independent modules

Medium Independence (±0 points):
  - Modify different sections of same file
  - Update related but separate components

High Dependency (-30 to -40 points):
  - Sequential task requirements
  - "Based on previous" keywords
  - Build on earlier task outputs

File Conflicts (-50 points, blocking):
  - Same file modifications
  - Same function/class edits
```

**Parallelization Decision Logic**:
```yaml
Parallel Execution (score ≥ 70):
  - Minimum 3 independent tasks
  - Zero file conflicts
  - No sequential dependencies

Sequential Batched (score 40-69):
  - Some dependencies manageable
  - Minor coordination overhead acceptable

Full Sequential (score < 40):
  - Strong dependencies
  - File conflicts present
```

#### Parallel Coordination Patterns

**Fan-Out/Fan-In** (Research Phase):
```
Orchestrator
    ├─→ Research Agent 1 (investigate existing patterns)
    ├─→ Research Agent 2 (analyze best practices)
    └─→ Research Agent 3 (web research industry standards)
         ↓
    Aggregation & Synthesis
```

**Hierarchical Delegation** (Implementation Phase):
```
Orchestrator
    ├─→ Planning Agent (synthesize research into plan)
    │       ↓
    └─→ Implementation Coordinator
            ├─→ Implementation Agent 1 (Phase 1 tasks)
            ├─→ Implementation Agent 2 (Phase 2 tasks)
            └─→ Testing Agent (validate all changes)
```

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery Architecture

#### Multi-Level Error Detection

**Agent-Level Monitoring**:
- Timeout detection (configurable per task type)
- Progress validation checkpoints
- Output format verification
- Tool access error handling

**Task-Level Validation**:
- File operation success verification
- Dependency availability checking
- Test execution results
- Integration conflict detection

**Workflow-Level Coordination**:
- Phase completion validation
- Cross-phase consistency checks
- Context preservation verification
- Overall workflow state management

#### Recovery Strategies (2025 Best Practices)

**Automatic Recovery**:
```yaml
Timeout Errors:
  strategy: retry_with_adjusted_parameters
  actions:
    - Extend timeout for complex tasks
    - Split large tasks into smaller components
    - Reassign to different agent configuration
  max_retries: 3

Tool Access Errors:
  strategy: graceful_degradation
  actions:
    - Verify tool permissions
    - Retry with reduced toolset
    - Fallback to sequential execution
  escalation: manual_intervention_after_2_failures

Validation Failures:
  strategy: iterative_correction
  actions:
    - Show detailed failure context
    - Provide correction guidance
    - Re-execute with fixes
  learning: track_common_patterns
```

**Checkpoint-Based Recovery**:
```yaml
Checkpoint Strategy:
  frequency: after_each_successful_phase
  storage: workflow_state_file
  contents:
    - completed_phases
    - current_phase_progress
    - accumulated_outputs
    - error_history
    - performance_metrics

Recovery Process:
  detection: workflow_interruption
  restoration: rollback_to_last_checkpoint
  continuation: resume_from_checkpoint_state
  validation: verify_state_consistency
```

**Self-Healing Mechanisms**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Alternative approach selection
- Task reassignment to different agents
- Partial success preservation

### 5. Workflow Orchestration Patterns

#### Sequential Phase Orchestration

**Standard Development Workflow**:
```yaml
Phase 1 - Research:
  type: parallel
  agents: [research_specialist_1, research_specialist_2, web_researcher]
  coordination: fan_out_fan_in
  outputs: [structured_research_reports]
  checkpoint: research_complete

Phase 2 - Planning:
  type: sequential
  agents: [planning_specialist]
  inputs: [research_reports]
  outputs: [implementation_plan]
  checkpoint: plan_ready

Phase 3 - Implementation:
  type: adaptive
  agents: [implementation_coordinator]
  inputs: [implementation_plan]
  coordination: phase_based_with_parallelization
  outputs: [code_changes, test_results]
  checkpoint: implementation_complete

Phase 4 - Documentation:
  type: sequential
  agents: [documentation_specialist]
  inputs: [implementation_results]
  outputs: [updated_documentation, summary]
  checkpoint: workflow_complete
```

#### Adaptive Workflow Patterns

**Debug → Fix → Test Cycle**:
```yaml
Loop Until Tests Pass:
  Phase 1: Debug Analysis
    - Investigate failures
    - Identify root causes
    - Generate fix proposals

  Phase 2: Implementation
    - Apply fixes from proposals
    - Update affected code
    - Run local validation

  Phase 3: Testing
    - Execute test suite
    - Analyze results
    - If fail: return to Phase 1 with context
    - If pass: proceed to documentation
```

#### Conditional Workflow Branching

```yaml
Feature Implementation:
  Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
    outputs: [complexity_score, existing_patterns]

  Conditional Branch (complexity_score):
    Simple (< 30):
      - Direct implementation
      - Single implementation agent
      - Basic testing

    Medium (30-70):
      - Research phase
      - Detailed planning
      - Phased implementation
      - Comprehensive testing

    Complex (> 70):
      - Multi-agent research
      - Architectural planning
      - Prototype development
      - Iterative implementation
      - Integration testing
      - Performance validation
```

### 6. Integration with Existing Command Ecosystem

#### SlashCommand Invocation Patterns

**Research Phase Integration**:
```yaml
Research Coordination:
  primary_command: /report <topic>
  parallel_invocations:
    - /report "existing codebase patterns for <feature>"
    - /report "best practices for <technology>"
    - /report "alternative approaches to <problem>"

  aggregation:
    method: synthesis_agent
    output: comprehensive_research_summary
    storage: specs/reports/NNN_*.md
```

**Planning Phase Integration**:
```yaml
Planning Coordination:
  primary_command: /plan <feature> [reports...]
  inputs: [research_reports_from_phase_1]
  process:
    - Synthesize research findings
    - Identify implementation approach
    - Break into phases and tasks
    - Define testing strategy
  output: specs/plans/NNN_*.md
```

**Implementation Phase Integration**:
```yaml
Implementation Coordination:
  primary_command: /implement [plan-file]
  enhancement: parallel_task_execution
  process:
    - Parse implementation plan phases
    - Analyze task dependencies
    - Invoke /subagents for parallel tasks
    - Sequential phase progression
    - Automated testing at each phase
    - Git commits per phase
  outputs:
    - code_changes
    - test_results
    - phase_commits
```

**Documentation Phase Integration**:
```yaml
Documentation Coordination:
  primary_command: /document [changes]
  process:
    - Analyze all changes from workflow
    - Update affected documentation
    - Cross-reference specs documents
    - Generate workflow summary
  outputs:
    - updated_READMEs
    - specs/summaries/NNN_*.md
```

#### Specs Directory Integration

**Workflow Documentation Structure**:
```
.claude/specs/
  ├── workflows/
  │   └── NNN_workflow_name.yml        # Workflow definitions
  ├── reports/
  │   ├── NNN_research_topic.md        # Research outputs
  │   └── NNN_orchestration_*.md       # Orchestration analysis
  ├── plans/
  │   └── NNN_implementation_plan.md   # Generated plans
  └── summaries/
      └── NNN_workflow_summary.md      # End-to-end results
```

**Cross-Referencing Strategy**:
```yaml
Workflow Summary Links:
  workflow_definition: "Link to workflow YAML"
  research_reports: ["List of generated reports"]
  implementation_plan: "Link to plan file"
  code_changes: ["List of modified files"]
  test_results: "Summary with details link"
  lessons_learned: "Insights from orchestration"
```

### Workflow Orchestration Process

```markdown
# Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

## Workflow Analysis
1. Parse workflow description and requirements
2. Identify natural phase boundaries
3. Analyze task dependencies
4. Determine parallelization opportunities
5. Generate execution plan with checkpoints

## Phase Coordination

### Research Phase (Parallel Execution)
- Delegate to multiple research subagents
- Topics: existing patterns, best practices, alternatives
- Coordination: fan-out/fan-in aggregation
- Output: Synthesized research findings
- Checkpoint: research_complete

### Planning Phase (Sequential Execution)
- Synthesize research into structured plan
- Invoke /plan command with research context
- Define phases, tasks, testing strategy
- Output: Implementation plan (specs/plans/)
- Checkpoint: plan_ready

### Implementation Phase (Adaptive Execution)
- Execute plan with /implement command
- Use /subagents for parallel task execution
- Phase-by-phase progression with testing
- Automated commits and validation
- Output: Code changes, test results
- Checkpoint: implementation_complete

### Debugging Loop (If Tests Fail)
- Invoke /debug to analyze failures
- Generate fix proposals
- Return to implementation with fixes
- Re-test until passing
- Checkpoint: tests_passing

### Documentation Phase (Sequential Execution)
- Invoke /document with all changes
- Update affected documentation
- Generate workflow summary
- Cross-reference all specs documents
- Checkpoint: workflow_complete

## Context Management Strategy

### Orchestrator Context (Minimal)
- Workflow state and current phase
- Phase completion checkpoints
- High-level decisions log
- Error recovery state
- Performance metrics

### Subagent Context (Comprehensive)
- Complete task description
- Relevant prior phase outputs
- Project standards (CLAUDE.md)
- Success criteria
- Validation requirements

### Context Passing Protocol
1. Extract minimal necessary context from prior phases
2. Structure as focused task description
3. Remove orchestration routing logic
4. Include explicit success criteria
5. Specify exact output format

## Error Recovery Mechanism

### Automatic Recovery
- Retry with adjusted parameters (3 max)
- Split complex tasks into components
- Reassign to different agent configurations
- Graceful degradation to sequential execution

### Checkpoint Recovery
- Save state after each successful phase
- Restore from last checkpoint on failure
- Preserve completed work
- Resume from interruption point

### Manual Intervention Points
- Critical integration failures
- Persistent test failures after retries
- User confirmation for major decisions
- Override automatic recovery decisions

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- Phase execution times
- Parallelization effectiveness
- Error rates and recovery success
- Context window utilization
- Resource consumption

### Optimization Recommendations
- Suggest workflow improvements
- Identify bottleneck phases
- Recommend parallelization opportunities
- Propose checkpoint placement refinements
```

### Orchestrator Prompt Engineering

**Key Principles**:
1. **Minimal State Retention**: Store only phase status, not full outputs
2. **Structured Handoffs**: Clear task descriptions with complete context
3. **Forward Message Pattern**: Pass subagent results directly when possible
4. **Checkpoint Discipline**: Save state religiously at phase boundaries
5. **Error Context Preservation**: Maintain failure history for learning

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Storing full subagent outputs in orchestrator context
- ❌ Paraphrasing subagent results (use forwarding)
- ❌ Including routing logic in subagent context
- ❌ Attempting complex implementation in orchestrator
- ❌ Missing checkpoint saves before transitions
