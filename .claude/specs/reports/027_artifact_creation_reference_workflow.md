# Artifact Creation and Reference Workflow Analysis

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Scope**: Comprehensive review of artifact creation/reference infrastructure in .claude/
- **Primary Directory**: .claude/specs/artifacts/
- **Files Analyzed**: 8 key files (commands, agents, utilities, README)
- **Research Time**: 45 minutes

## Executive Summary

The `.claude/` system has **comprehensive artifact infrastructure documentation** but **zero implementation**. All artifact workflows exist only in markdown specifications within command documentation. Key findings:

- ✅ **Documentation Complete**: artifact-utils.sh, artifacts/README.md, research-specialist.md all describe full workflow
- ❌ **Zero Implementation**: No commands actually create, store, or reference artifacts
- ❌ **No Integration**: /orchestrate, /report, /plan documented to use artifacts but don't
- ⚠️ **Design Ready**: Complete utility library exists (artifact-utils.sh with 15 functions)
- ⚠️ **Spec-Reality Gap**: Commands describe sophisticated artifact workflows in documentation but execute without them

**Status**: Artifacts are a **design specification only**. Implementation requires integrating artifact creation into research-specialist invocations and artifact references into planning/reporting phases.

## Background

### Purpose of Artifacts

Artifacts are lightweight research outputs designed to reduce context usage in multi-agent workflows:

**Problem**: Research summaries from agents consume 150-200 words each
**Solution**: Write research to files, pass 10-word file references instead
**Benefit**: 60-80% context reduction while preserving full research

### Intended Use Cases

1. **Multi-Agent Research** (/orchestrate workflows)
   - Parallel research-specialist agents create artifacts
   - Planning agent receives artifact references, reads selectively
   - Context reduced from 600+ words (3 summaries) to ~50 words (3 references)

2. **Reusable Research** (Cross-workflow efficiency)
   - Same artifact referenced by multiple plans
   - Institutional knowledge preserved beyond single workflow
   - Avoid duplicate research on similar features

3. **Progressive Context Loading** (On-demand reading)
   - Agents receive artifact paths, not content
   - Read only relevant artifacts using Read tool
   - Pay context cost only for needed information

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

#### 1. Artifact Directory Structure

**Location**: `.claude/specs/artifacts/`

**Status**: ✅ Directory exists, ✅ README.md comprehensive

**Structure** (from README.md):
```
artifacts/
├── {project_name}/        # Project-specific artifacts
│   ├── existing_patterns.md
│   ├── best_practices.md
│   └── alternatives.md
└── {another_project}/
    └── api_research.md
```

**Naming Convention**:
- Path format: `artifacts/{project_name}/{artifact_name}.md`
- Project names: snake_case derived from feature (e.g., "auth_system", "payment_flow")
- Artifact names: Descriptive filenames (e.g., "existing_patterns", "best_practices")

**Current Contents**: Only README.md (no actual artifacts exist)

#### 2. Artifact Utility Library

**Location**: `.claude/lib/artifact-utils.sh`

**Status**: ✅ Complete implementation (545 lines, 15 functions)

**Core Functions**:
- `register_artifact(type, path, metadata)` - Register in .claude/registry/
- `query_artifacts(type, pattern)` - Find artifacts by type/name
- `update_artifact_status(id, metadata)` - Update artifact metadata
- `cleanup_artifacts(days)` - Remove old artifact registry entries
- `validate_artifact_references(type)` - Check if paths still exist

**Metadata Extraction Functions** (Context optimization):
- `get_plan_metadata(path)` - Extract plan info without reading full file
- `get_report_metadata(path)` - Extract report info from header only
- `get_plan_phase(path, N)` - Extract single phase on-demand
- `get_plan_section(path, heading)` - Extract section by heading
- `get_report_section(path, heading)` - Extract report section

**Registry**: Artifacts tracked in `.claude/registry/{artifact_id}.json` files

**Usage**: Functions exported, ready for sourcing in commands

**Current Integration**: ❌ No commands source or use these utilities

#### 3. Research-Specialist Agent

**Location**: `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md`

**Status**: ✅ Agent definition complete with artifact mode documentation

**Artifact Output Mode** (Lines 162-195):

Documented workflow:
1. Receive artifact path from orchestrator
2. Conduct research normally
3. Format output with metadata header
4. Write to `specs/artifacts/{project_name}/{artifact_name}.md`
5. Return artifact ID and path instead of full summary

**Artifact File Structure Template**:
```markdown
# {Research Topic}

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-10-03
- **Workflow**: {workflow_description}
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Focus**: {specific_research_topic}

## Findings
{Detailed research findings - 150 words}

## Recommendations
{Key recommendations from research}
```

**Benefits Listed**:
- Context reduction (artifact ref ~10 words vs summary ~150 words)
- Reusability across plans/reports
- Organization by project in specs/artifacts/
- Full findings preserved, not compressed

**Current Reality**: ❌ Agent invocations don't provide artifact paths, agent doesn't write artifacts

#### 4. /orchestrate Command

**Location**: `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`

**Status**: ✅ Comprehensive artifact workflow documented (2500+ words on artifacts)

**Documented Workflow** (Lines 267-410):

**Step 3.5**: Generate Project Name for Artifacts
- Derives snake_case name from workflow description
- Examples: "Implement user auth" → "user_auth"
- Stored in `workflow_state.project_name`

**Step 4**: Store Research as Artifacts
- Generate artifact path: `specs/artifacts/{project_name}/{artifact_name}.md`
- Create project directory if needed
- Write research findings with metadata header
- Register artifact with ID: `research_001`, `research_002`, etc.
- Return artifact reference (~10 words) instead of full summary (~150 words)

**Step 5**: Aggregate Artifact References
- Collect artifact IDs and paths (not full content)
- Build reference list with one-sentence summaries
- Context reduction: 200+ words → ~50 words
- Pass to planning agent

**Artifact Reference Template**:
```markdown
Available Research Artifacts:
1. **research_001** - Existing Patterns
   - Path: specs/artifacts/{project_name}/existing_patterns.md
   - Focus: Current implementation analysis
   - Use Read tool to access full findings
```

**Planning Agent Prompt** (Lines 487-508):
- Receives artifact reference list
- Instructed to use Read tool to selectively access artifacts
- Not all artifacts need to be read

**Documentation Phase** (Lines 1382-1490):
- Cross-reference artifacts in workflow summary
- Link research artifacts, plan, and summary bidirectionally

**Current Reality**: ❌ /orchestrate command doesn't exist as executable
❌ Workflow described but not implemented
❌ No artifact creation or reference code

#### 5. /plan Command

**Location**: `.claude/commands/plan.md`

**Status**: ✅ Artifact integration documented

**Artifact Support** (Lines 337-341):
- Plans created from /orchestrate workflows should reference research artifacts
- Template includes "Related Artifacts" section
- Links to `../artifacts/{project_name}/` paths

**Current Reality**: ❌ /plan doesn't receive or handle artifact references
❌ Plans don't include artifact cross-references

#### 6. /plan-wizard Command

**Location**: `.claude/commands/plan-wizard.md`

**Status**: ✅ Artifact workflow documented (700+ words on artifacts)

**Documented Features** (Lines 238-277):
- Creates `.claude/specs/artifacts/` directory
- Stores research artifacts (not in specs/reports/)
- Passes artifact references to /plan command
- Preserves artifacts on interrupt

**Wizard vs Report Storage**:
- Wizard artifacts → `.claude/specs/artifacts/` (reusable, lightweight)
- /report outputs → `specs/reports/` (comprehensive, final)

**Current Reality**: ❌ /plan-wizard doesn't exist as executable
❌ No artifact creation implemented

### Workflow State Registry

**Location**: `.claude/registry/` (mentioned in artifact-utils.sh:18)

**Purpose**: Track generated artifacts with JSON metadata

**Registry Entry Format**:
```json
{
  "artifact_id": "plan_auth_20251009_143052",
  "artifact_type": "plan",
  "artifact_path": "specs/plans/025_auth_implementation.md",
  "created_at": "2025-10-09T14:30:52Z",
  "metadata": {
    "status": "completed",
    "phases": 5,
    "tests_passing": true
  }
}
```

**Artifact Types**:
- `plan` - Implementation plans
- `report` - Research reports
- `summary` - Implementation summaries
- `checkpoint` - Workflow checkpoints

**Current State**: ❌ .claude/registry/ directory doesn't exist
❌ No registry entries created by any command

```

### Finding 2: Utility Library Ready for Integration

artifact-utils.sh provides complete functionality:

✅ **Artifact Registration**: `register_artifact()` creates registry entries
✅ **Artifact Querying**: `query_artifacts()` finds by type/pattern
✅ **Status Tracking**: `update_artifact_status()` updates metadata
✅ **Lifecycle Management**: `cleanup_artifacts()` removes old entries
✅ **Validation**: `validate_artifact_references()` checks path existence

✅ **Context Optimization**: 5 functions for metadata extraction
- Read plan/report metadata without loading full files
- Extract single phase/section on-demand
- Support progressive context loading

**Integration Requirement**: Commands need to `source` artifact-utils.sh and call functions

**Current Blocker**: No command implementations exist to integrate with

### Finding 3: Research-Specialist Agent Artifact Mode Documented but Unused

**Agent Definition** (research-specialist.md) includes:
- Artifact output mode documentation (lines 162-195)
- File structure template
- Metadata header format
- Benefits explanation

**Agent Invocation Reality**:
- No commands invoke research-specialist with artifact paths
- Agent prompts don't include artifact output instructions
- Agent returns summaries, not artifact references

**Required Changes**:
1. Pass artifact path to research-specialist in prompt
2. Instruct agent to write findings to artifact file
3. Agent returns artifact ID instead of full summary

**Example Invocation** (currently missing):
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Follow research-specialist protocol from:
    .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    Research [topic]

    OUTPUT MODE: Artifact
    - Write findings to: specs/artifacts/user_auth/existing_patterns.md
    - Include metadata header (date, workflow, focus)
    - Return artifact ID and path (not full summary)
}
```

### Finding 4: Orchestrate Workflow Extensively Documented but Not Implemented

**/orchestrate command** exists only as markdown documentation:

**Documented Workflow** (orchestrate.md):
- Step 3.5: Generate project name for artifact paths
- Step 4: Store research as artifacts (create dirs, write files, register)
- Step 5: Aggregate artifact references (build reference list)
- Planning phase: Pass artifact refs to plan-architect
- Documentation phase: Cross-reference artifacts in summary

**Reality**:
- No executable orchestrate command file (.sh, .py, executable)
- Documented workflow is specification, not implementation
- No code exists to create artifact directories
- No code exists to write artifact files
- No code exists to generate artifact references

**Status**: orchestrate.md is a **design document**, not an executable command

### Finding 5: Artifact Cross-Referencing Not Implemented

**Documented Cross-References**:

Plans should link to research artifacts:
```markdown
## Related Artifacts
- [Existing Patterns](../artifacts/auth_system/existing_patterns.md)
- [Best Practices](../artifacts/auth_system/best_practices.md)
```

Summaries should link to artifacts:
```markdown
## Research Artifacts
- [Research 001](../artifacts/auth_system/existing_patterns.md)
- [Research 002](../artifacts/auth_system/best_practices.md)
```

**Reality**:
- No plans contain artifact cross-references
- No summaries link to artifacts
- No automated cross-reference generation

**Reason**: No artifacts exist to reference

### Finding 6: Project Name Generation Not Implemented

**Documented Algorithm** (orchestrate.md:272-285):
```
"Implement user authentication" → "user_auth"
"Add OAuth2 support" → "oauth2_support"
"Refactor session management" → "session_management"
```

**Process**:
1. Take workflow description
2. Extract key nouns/concepts
3. Convert to snake_case
4. Store in workflow_state.project_name
5. Use for artifact path generation

**Reality**: No code implements this algorithm

**Workaround**: Manual project naming or default to workflow timestamp

### Finding 7: Registry System Defined but Not Created

**Registry Purpose**: Track all artifacts with queryable metadata

**Expected Location**: `.claude/registry/`

**Expected Contents**: JSON files per artifact
- File naming: `{artifact_type}_{name}_{timestamp}.json`
- Example: `research_existing_patterns_20251009_143052.json`

**Current State**:
```bash
$ ls -la .claude/registry/
ls: cannot access '.claude/registry/': No such file or directory
```

**Utility Functions Available**:
- `register_artifact()` - Would create registry entries
- `query_artifacts()` - Would search registry
- `cleanup_artifacts()` - Would remove old entries

**Blocker**: No commands call these functions

## Gaps in Artifact Workflow

### Gap 1: Research Agent Artifact Output

**Missing**: Code to instruct research-specialist to write artifacts

**Required Implementation**:

1. **In /orchestrate research phase** (if it existed):
```bash
# Generate artifact path
artifact_path="specs/artifacts/${project_name}/existing_patterns.md"

# Create artifact directory
mkdir -p "specs/artifacts/${project_name}"

# Invoke research-specialist with artifact instructions
task_prompt="
Follow research-specialist protocol.

Research [topic]

OUTPUT MODE: Artifact
- Write findings to: ${artifact_path}
- Include metadata:
  - Created: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
  - Workflow: ${workflow_description}
  - Agent: research-specialist
  - Focus: ${research_topic}
- Format: markdown with ## Findings and ## Recommendations sections

Return: artifact_id and path only (not full summary)
"

# Invoke agent
artifact_result=$(Task general-purpose "Research [topic]" "$task_prompt")

# Extract artifact path from result
# Register artifact
register_artifact "research" "$artifact_path" '{"topic":"existing_patterns"}'
```

2. **In research-specialist agent response**:
```markdown
Artifact Created:
- ID: research_001
- Path: specs/artifacts/user_auth/existing_patterns.md
- Size: 847 bytes
- Findings: 3 key patterns identified

Use Read tool to access full findings.
```

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented anywhere

### Gap 2: Artifact Reference Generation

**Missing**: Code to generate artifact reference lists

**Required Implementation**:

After all research agents complete:
```bash
# Build artifact reference list
artifact_refs=""
artifact_count=0

for artifact_id in "${!artifact_registry[@]}"; do
  artifact_path="${artifact_registry[$artifact_id]}"
  artifact_count=$((artifact_count + 1))

  # Extract one-sentence summary (first line of ## Findings section)
  summary=$(get_report_section "$artifact_path" "Findings" | head -5 | tail -1)

  artifact_refs+="
${artifact_count}. **${artifact_id}** - ${artifact_name}
   - Path: ${artifact_path}
   - Focus: ${artifact_focus}
   - Key Finding: ${summary}
"
done

# Pass to planning agent
plan_prompt="
...

### Research Artifacts
${artifact_refs}

Instructions: Use Read tool to selectively access artifacts.
"
```

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented anywhere

### Gap 3: Artifact Path Provision to Agents

**Missing**: Mechanism to tell agents where to write artifacts

**Current Agent Invocations**:
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: "Research authentication patterns. Provide concise summary."
}
```

**Required Agent Invocations**:
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: "
    Research authentication patterns.

    OUTPUT MODE: Artifact
    - Write to: specs/artifacts/user_auth/existing_patterns.md
    - Format: markdown with metadata header
    - Return: artifact path only
  "
}
```

**Gap**: No commands generate artifact paths or include output mode instructions

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented anywhere

### Gap 4: Artifact Cross-Reference Insertion

**Missing**: Code to add artifact links to plans/reports/summaries

**Required Implementation**:

1. **During plan creation** (if /plan received artifact refs):
```bash
# After generating plan content
# Before writing plan file

# Add Related Artifacts section
cat >> "$plan_file" <<EOF

## Related Artifacts

This plan incorporates research from the following artifacts:

$(for artifact_id in "${!artifact_registry[@]}"; do
  artifact_path="${artifact_registry[$artifact_id]}"
  artifact_name=$(basename "$artifact_path" .md | tr '_' ' ' | sed 's/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g')
  echo "- [${artifact_name}](../${artifact_path})"
done)

EOF
```

2. **During summary generation** (in /orchestrate documentation phase):
```bash
# Add Research Artifacts section to summary
cat >> "$summary_file" <<EOF

## Research Artifacts

This workflow used the following research artifacts:

$(for artifact_id in "${!artifact_registry[@]}"; do
  artifact_path="${artifact_registry[$artifact_id]}"
  echo "- **${artifact_id}**: [${artifact_path}](../../${artifact_path})"
done)

EOF
```

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented anywhere

### Gap 5: Artifact Registry Integration

**Missing**: Commands that call artifact-utils.sh functions

**Required Integration**:

1. **Source utility library** (at command start):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Source artifact utilities
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../lib/artifact-utils.sh"
```

2. **Register artifacts** (after creation):
```bash
# Register research artifact
artifact_id=$(register_artifact "research" "$artifact_path" '{
  "topic": "existing_patterns",
  "workflow": "'"$workflow_description"'",
  "project": "'"$project_name"'"
}')

echo "Registered artifact: $artifact_id"
```

3. **Query artifacts** (for reuse):
```bash
# Check if research already exists for project
existing_artifacts=$(query_artifacts "research" "$project_name")

if [ "$existing_artifacts" != "[]" ]; then
  echo "Existing research found:"
  list_artifacts "research"
  echo ""
  read -p "Reuse existing research? (y/n): " reuse
fi
```

4. **Update artifact status** (during implementation):
```bash
# Update plan artifact when phase completes
update_artifact_status "$plan_artifact_id" '{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_phase": 3,
  "tests_passing": true
}'
```

**Status**: ❌ No commands source artifact-utils.sh
❌ No commands call artifact functions

### Gap 6: Artifact Lifecycle Management

**Missing**: Cleanup and validation processes

**Required Implementation**:

1. **Periodic cleanup** (monthly or on-demand):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# cleanup-old-artifacts.sh

source ".claude/lib/artifact-utils.sh"

# Remove registry entries older than 90 days
count=$(cleanup_artifacts 90)
echo "Cleaned up $count old artifact registry entries"

# Validate all artifact references
report=$(validate_artifact_references)
invalid_count=$(echo "$report" | jq '.invalid')

if [ "$invalid_count" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Warning: $invalid_count artifacts have invalid paths"
  echo "$report" | jq '.invalid_artifacts'
fi
```

2. **Validation on command start**:
```bash
# In /implement or /orchestrate
# Validate referenced artifacts still exist
for artifact_id in "${!artifact_registry[@]}"; do
  artifact_path="${artifact_registry[$artifact_id]}"

  if [ ! -f "$artifact_path" ]; then
    echo "Warning: Artifact not found: $artifact_path"
    echo "Removing invalid reference from registry"
    unset artifact_registry[$artifact_id]
  fi
done
```

**Status**: ❌ No cleanup scripts exist
❌ No validation integrated into commands

### Gap 7: Artifact Directory Auto-Creation

**Missing**: Automatic creation of project-specific artifact directories

**Required Implementation**:

```bash
# In /orchestrate research phase (before launching research agents)

# Generate project name from workflow description
project_name=$(echo "$workflow_description" | \
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
  sed 's/[^a-z0-9 ]//g' | \
  tr ' ' '_' | \
  sed 's/__*/_/g' | \
  sed 's/^_//; s/_$//')

# Create artifact directory for project
artifact_dir="specs/artifacts/${project_name}"
mkdir -p "$artifact_dir"

echo "Created artifact directory: $artifact_dir"
```

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented anywhere

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Artifact Creation (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Enable research-specialist to write artifacts

**Tasks**:
1. Create artifact directory auto-creation function
   - Input: workflow description
   - Output: project_name, artifact_dir path

   - How to reuse artifacts across workflows
   - How to clean up old artifacts
   - How to manually reference artifacts

**Deliverables**:
- End-to-end test script
- Updated command documentation
- User guide: "Working with Artifacts"

**Testing**:
- Run full workflow test
- Verify all artifact operations work
- Validate documentation accuracy

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Acknowledge Spec-Reality Gap**
   - Update command documentation to clarify artifacts are "planned" not "implemented"
   - Add "Status: Design Phase" banners to artifact sections
   - Prevent user confusion about artifact support

2. **Prioritize Implementation**
   - Start with Phase 1 (Core Artifact Creation)
   - Focus on research-specialist artifact output mode
   - Get basic artifact creation working before complex features

3. **Incremental Integration**
   - Don't try to implement all 6 phases at once
   - Get Phase 1 working, test thoroughly
   - Add Phase 2, test integration
   - Progress incrementally to avoid big-bang integration issues

### Design Decisions Needed

1. **Command Implementation vs Spec-Only**
   - Decision: Are commands executable files or markdown specs?
   - If executable: Implement orchestrate.sh, plan-wizard.sh
   - If spec-only: Clarify documentation is prompt templates, not executables

2. **Artifact Creation Responsibility**
   - Option A: research-specialist agent writes artifacts directly
   - Option B: orchestrator wraps agent output and writes artifacts
   - Option C: Hybrid - agent writes if capable, orchestrator wraps otherwise

3. **Project Naming Strategy**
   - Option A: Auto-generate from workflow description (complex algorithm)
   - Option B: Prompt user for project name (simple, accurate)
   - Option C: Use workflow timestamp as project name (guaranteed unique)

4. **Artifact Reuse Policy**
   - Should commands detect existing research and offer reuse?
   - Should old artifacts be automatically cleaned up or preserved indefinitely?
   - Should artifact updates be versioned (artifact_v1, artifact_v2) or overwrite?

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Agent Output Modes**
   - Formalize "artifact mode" vs "summary mode" for agents
   - Pass output mode as explicit parameter
   - Agent self-selects output format based on mode

2. **Registry as Single Source of Truth**
   - All artifact operations go through registry
   - Query registry instead of filesystem searches
   - Registry tracks versions, updates, cross-references

3. **Artifact Templates**
   - Create templates for common artifact types
   - Ensure consistent metadata format
   - Validate artifacts against schema

### Long-Term Vision

1. **Smart Artifact Reuse**
   - Detect similar workflows (NLP similarity)
   - Suggest relevant artifacts from past workflows
   - Build institutional knowledge base

2. **Artifact Versioning**
   - Track artifact updates over time
   - Compare artifact versions (diff)
   - Rollback to previous artifact versions

3. **Cross-Project Artifact Sharing**
   - Share artifacts across codebases
   - Central artifact repository
   - Artifact discovery and search

4. **Artifact Quality Metrics**
   - Track artifact usage frequency
   - Identify stale or unused artifacts
   - Quality scores based on helpfulness

## Summary

The `.claude/` system has **comprehensive artifact infrastructure design** with **zero implementation**. Key components exist as documentation only:

**What Exists** (Documentation):
- ✅ Complete artifact-utils.sh utility library (545 lines)
- ✅ Comprehensive artifacts/README.md (160 lines)
- ✅ Research-specialist artifact output mode spec (60 lines)
- ✅ Extensive /orchestrate artifact workflow (2500+ words)
- ✅ /plan-wizard artifact integration (700+ words)

**What's Missing** (All Implementation):
- ❌ No commands create artifact files
- ❌ No commands reference artifacts
- ❌ No research agents write to artifact paths
- ❌ No artifact directories created
- ❌ No registry entries generated
- ❌ No cross-references in plans/reports/summaries

**Implementation Path**: Follow 6-phase roadmap (7-11 hours total):
1. Core artifact creation (enable research-specialist to write artifacts)
2. Registry integration (track artifacts with metadata)
3. Reference system (pass artifact refs instead of summaries)
4. Cross-reference insertion (link artifacts in plans/summaries)
5. Lifecycle management (cleanup, validation, reuse)
6. Integration testing (end-to-end validation)

**Immediate Need**: Acknowledge spec-reality gap in documentation, prioritize Phase 1 implementation to enable basic artifact creation.
