## Gap Analysis: What's Missing for Modern Workflow

### Critical Gaps (High Priority)

#### 1. ❌ Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**Missing Components**:
- **Metrics Collection**: No active tracking of command performance
  - Phase execution times logged but not aggregated
  - No trend analysis over time
  - No bottleneck identification
  - No resource utilization tracking

- **Optimization Recommendations**:
  - `/orchestrate` mentions performance metrics but doesn't act on them
  - No automatic optimization suggestions
  - No learning from past workflow executions

**Impact**: Can't identify slow commands or optimize workflow efficiency over time.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- Create `/metrics` command for performance visualization
- Add `.claude/data/metrics/` directory for historical data
- Implement performance dashboards (CLI-based)
- Auto-suggest optimizations based on metrics

#### 2. ❌ Real-Time Workflow Visualization

**Missing Components**:
- **Progress Tracking**: TodoWrite tool used but no visual representation
  - No command-line progress bars for long operations
  - No phase transition visualization
  - No agent activity dashboard during /orchestrate

- **State Visibility**:
  - Can't see current orchestration state while running
  - No indication of parallel agent progress
  - No live log streaming for subagents

**Impact**: Long-running workflows feel like black boxes; hard to know what's happening.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- ASCII-based workflow diagrams during execution
- Live progress bars for each phase
- Subagent activity log (real-time)
- `/status` command to check active workflows

#### 3. ❌ Persistent Workflow State Management

**Missing Components**:
- **Workflow Persistence**:
  - Checkpoints mentioned but not stored to disk
  - Workflows are ephemeral (lost on CLI restart)
  - Can't resume orchestrate workflows after interruption
  - No workflow queue (run multiple workflows sequentially)

- **State Recovery**:
  - `/resume-implement` exists but only for plan execution
  - No general-purpose workflow resume
  - No "pick up where you left off" for /orchestrate

**Impact**: Interruptions (network, system crash) lose all progress; must restart from beginning.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `.claude/state/` directory for persistent checkpoints
- `/workflows list` - Show active/paused workflows
- `/workflows resume <id>` - Resume interrupted workflow
- Automatic state persistence every N minutes

#### 4. ❌ CI/CD Integration Hooks

**Missing Components**:
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: No workflows or actions
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Not configured
- **Git Hooks**: No automatic validation before commits
- **Remote Trigger**: Can't trigger workflows from CI

**Impact**: Manual workflow invocation only; no automation on git events.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `.github/workflows/claude-orchestrate.yml` template
- Git hooks for pre-commit validation (/validate-setup, /test)
- Remote API for CI systems to trigger workflows
- Status reporting back to GitHub (check runs)

### High Priority Gaps

#### 5. ❌ Team Collaboration Features

**Missing Components**:
- **Shared Workflow History**: No team-visible workflow logs
- **Code Review Integration**: Plans/implementations not linked to PRs
- **Conflict Resolution**: No multi-developer coordination
- **Review Workflows**: Can't assign plan reviews or approvals

**Impact**: Solo-developer focused; limited team utility.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `.claude/shared/` for team-visible artifacts
- `/review create <plan>` - Request plan/implementation review
- Integration with GitHub PR workflow
- Workflow ownership and assignment

#### 6. ❌ Dependency and File Conflict Detection

**Missing Components**:
- **File Lock Awareness**: No detection of concurrent modifications
- **Dependency Analysis**: Plan doesn't analyze cross-file dependencies
- **Conflict Prevention**: Can't detect when two plans modify same file
- **Resource Coordination**: Resource allocation protocols defined but not implemented

**Impact**: Parallel workflow execution could cause file conflicts.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- File locking system (`.claude/locks/`)
- Dependency graph analysis in /plan
- Conflict warnings before /implement
- Implement resource-manager from command-protocols.md

#### 7. ⚠️ Enhanced Error Recovery (Partial)

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Automatic retry (3 attempts)
- ✅ Debugging loop (3 iterations)
- ✅ Checkpoint system (in-memory)

**Missing**:
- ❌ Smart retry strategies (exponential backoff with jitter)
- ❌ Circuit breaker pattern (prevent cascade failures)
- ❌ Fallback workflows (alternative approach on repeated failure)
- ❌ Error pattern learning (don't retry known unrecoverable errors)
- ❌ Graceful degradation levels (continue with reduced functionality)

**Impact**: Error recovery is basic; doesn't learn from patterns.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- Error pattern database (`.claude/errors/patterns.json`)
- Intelligent retry with increasing delays
- Circuit breaker state machine
- Fallback workflow definitions

### Medium Priority Gaps

#### 8. ❌ Workflow Templates and Presets

**Missing Components**:
- **Common Workflows**: No templates for typical tasks
  - "Add new feature" workflow
  - "Fix bug" workflow
  - "Refactor module" workflow
  - "Add test coverage" workflow

- **Customization**: Can't save custom workflows
- **Sharing**: No community workflow repository

**Impact**: Must describe full workflow each time; no reusable patterns.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `.claude/workflows/` directory for templates
- `/orchestrate --template feature` - Use predefined workflow
- `/orchestrate --save <name>` - Save custom workflow
- Template parameters for customization

#### 9. ❌ Advanced Search and Navigation

**Missing Components**:
- **Semantic Search**: Can't search reports/plans by concepts
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Which plans reference which reports?
- **Dependency Graphs**: Visual representation of spec dependencies
- **Tag System**: No tagging for organizing specs

**Impact**: Hard to find relevant past work; manual grep required.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `/search <query>` - Semantic search across all specs
- `/graph` - Visualize spec dependencies
- Tag support in spec frontmatter
- Full-text indexing for faster search

#### 10. ❌ Configuration Management

**Missing Components**:
- **User Preferences**: No persistent preferences
- **Project Profiles**: Can't switch between project configurations
- **Environment Variables**: No support for env-based config
- **Secrets Management**: Credentials not handled securely

**Impact**: Must specify preferences repeatedly; no project-specific settings.

**Recommended Implementation**:
- `.claude/config.yml` - Global configuration
- `.claude/project.yml` - Project-specific overrides
- `$CLAUDE_PROFILE` environment variable
- Secrets stored in keychain/encrypted

### Low Priority Gaps (Nice-to-Have)

#### 11. ❌ Interactive Workflow Designer

**Missing**: GUI or TUI for visually designing workflows

**Impact**: Must write workflow descriptions; higher barrier for complex flows.

**Recommended**: TUI (terminal UI) for interactive workflow design

#### 12. ❌ Notification System

**Missing**: No notifications on workflow completion/failure

**Impact**: Must poll for status; interruptions not communicated.

**Recommended**: OS notifications (notify-send, macOS notification center)

#### 13. ❌ Workflow Scheduling

**Missing**: Can't schedule workflows for future execution

**Impact**: Must manually trigger; no cron-like scheduling.

**Recommended**: `/orchestrate --at "2025-10-02 09:00"` for scheduled runs

#### 14. ❌ Multi-Project Support

**Missing**: Hard to manage workflows across multiple projects

**Impact**: Must CD into project; no cross-project orchestration.

**Recommended**: `/orchestrate --project <name>` for multi-project workflows

#### 15. ❌ Audit Logs and Compliance

**Missing**: No comprehensive audit trail

**Impact**: Can't trace who changed what or prove compliance.

**Recommended**: `.claude/audit/` for tamper-evident logs
