### Source Material

**Original Files** (from commit 40b9146^):
- orchestrate.md: 2,720 lines
- implement.md: 987 lines

- Plan Hierarchy Update sections: 158 lines total
- Topic-based directory paths: 138 net lines
- Total preserved: ~300 lines

### Merge Strategy

1. **Simple Commands** (revise.md, setup.md):
   - Direct restoration from 40b9146^
   - No improvements to preserve
   - Clean replacement strategy

2. **Complex Commands** (implement.md, orchestrate.md):
   - Restored base content from 40b9146^
   - Manually merged Plan Hierarchy Update sections
   - Verified integration points and context

### Restoration Phases

- **Phase 1**: Preparation and extraction ✅
  - Created working directories in /tmp/command_restoration/
  - Extracted original files from commit 40b9146^
  - Created backups of damaged files

- **Phase 2**: Restore simple commands ✅
  - Restored revise.md (406 → 878 lines)
  - Restored setup.md (375 → 911 lines)
  - Commit: c8654c1

- **Phase 3**: Restore implement.md with hierarchy ✅
  - Restored base content (620 → 987 lines)
  - Merged Plan Hierarchy Update section (+86 lines)
  - Final: 1,073 lines
  - Commit: 2fecf25

- **Phase 4**: Restore orchestrate.md with hierarchy ✅
  - Restored base content (922 → 2,720 lines)
  - Merged Plan Hierarchy Update section (+72 lines)
  - Final: 2,793 lines
  - Commit: bb19e01

- **Phase 5**: Validation and documentation ✅

## Prevention Measures

### Standards Created

Created `.claude/docs/command_architecture_standards.md` with 22 comprehensive standards sections covering:
- Executable instructions inline requirements
- Template completeness criteria
- Critical warning preservation
- External reference guidelines
- Refactoring protocols for command files
- Testing checklist for command changes

### CLAUDE.md Integration

Updated `/home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md` with new section:

```markdown
### Command and Agent Architecture Standards
[Used by: All slash commands and agent development]

- Command files are AI execution scripts, not traditional code
- Executable instructions must be inline
- Templates must be complete and copy-paste ready
- Critical warnings must stay in command files
- Reference files provide supplemental context only
```

### Testing Checklist

Pre-commit hook recommendations added to standards document:
- Pattern presence verification (numbered steps, CRITICAL warnings, Task templates)
- Line count change detection (>20% reduction triggers review)
- External reference audit (ensure supplemental only)
- Agent template completeness check

## Lessons Learned

### Command Files Are Not Code

Traditional software engineering principles (DRY, modularization, extraction) do not apply to AI prompt files. Command files are execution scripts that Claude reads during invocation - they require direct, inline instructions to function.

### External References Are Supplemental

While external reference files can provide valuable context and extended examples, they cannot replace core execution instructions. Claude needs the primary workflow steps, agent templates, and critical warnings directly visible in the command file.

### Preservation During Restoration

When restoring from git history, it's critical to:
1. Identify valuable work added after the damage
2. Create a comprehensive plan for selective merging
3. Validate both restoration and preservation
4. Document exactly what was kept and why

- **Implementation Plan**: `.claude/specs/plans/054_restore_command_execution_capability.md`

## Conclusion

The restoration successfully recovered 3,173 lines of critical executable instructions while preserving 300 lines of valuable improvements. All 4 command files are now fully functional with complete inline execution instructions, agent templates, and workflow specifications.

The creation of comprehensive architecture standards and integration with CLAUDE.md provides strong protection against future regressions. The testing checklist and pre-commit hook recommendations offer practical mechanisms for early detection of similar issues.

**Restoration Status**: ✅ Complete and validated
**Functionality Status**: ✅ All commands fully operational
**Prevention Status**: ✅ Standards documented and integrated
