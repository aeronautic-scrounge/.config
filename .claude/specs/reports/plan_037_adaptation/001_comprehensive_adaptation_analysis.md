# Plan 037 Adaptation Analysis - Comprehensive Report

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Report Number**: 001
- **Topic**: plan_037_adaptation
- **Scope**: Comprehensive analysis of mismatches between Plan 037 and current implementation
- **Plan Location**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/plans/037_reduce_implementation_interruptions/
- **Files Analyzed**:
  - Plan 037 (502 lines)
  - implement.md (868 lines, expected 868)
  - orchestrate.md (5405 lines, expected 1953)
  - CLAUDE.md (408 lines)
  - Phase 2 expansion (988 lines)
  - Phase 4 expansion (1320 lines)

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding**: Plan 037 was written on 2025-10-10 and revised 2025-10-12, but the codebase underwent **massive refactoring** in the interim. The plan's line number references, file sizes, and structural assumptions are **extensively outdated** due to:

1. **orchestrate.md grew 178%**: From expected 1953 lines to actual 5405 lines
2. **Phase 5-8 orchestrate refactors**: Complete rewrite with debugging loop, implementation phase refactor, execution infrastructure
3. **Adaptive planning fully implemented**: `/revise --auto-mode`, complexity scoring, auto-collapse, loop prevention
4. **Documentation consolidation**: 37 files removed from archived/backup directories

**Recommendation**: **Plan 037 requires complete rewrite**, not adaptation. The objectives remain valid, but nearly all implementation details (line numbers, step references, file structures) are invalid.

## Critical Mismatches

### 1. File Size Discrepancies

| File | Plan Expects | Actual | Discrepancy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| orchestrate.md | 1953 lines | **5405 lines** | +178% (3452 lines added) |
| implement.md | 868 lines | 868 lines | ✓ Match |
| CLAUDE.md | ~300 lines (implied) | 408 lines | +108 lines |

**Impact**: All line number references in orchestrate.md phases (Phase 6) are **completely invalid**.

### 2. Structural Changes in orchestrate.md

**Plan assumes checkpoint section at lines 1884-1908**:
```markdown
Phase 6 Task: Read orchestrate.md checkpoint detection section (lines 1884-1908)
```

**Reality**: Checkpoint section now at lines 5334-5391 (shift of +3450 lines)

**Grep results show checkpoint scattered throughout**:
- Line 106: Step 3 checkpoint detection
- Line 918: Step 5 research checkpoint
- Line 1220: Implementation checkpoint
- Line 1572: Planning checkpoint
- Line 2296-2303: Success/failure checkpoints
- Line 4161: Final checkpoint
- Line 5334: **Main checkpoint section** (expected location)

**Cause**: Phases 5-8 added massive amounts of content:
- Phase 5: Debugging loop refactor
- Phase 6: Implementation phase refactor
- Phase 7: Execution infrastructure
- Phase 8: Integration testing

### 3. implement.md Step Structure Mismatch

**Plan assumes removable steps**:
- Phase 3: "Remove Step 1.55 'Proactive Expansion Check' (lines 274-287)"
- Phase 3: "Remove Step 3.4 'Adaptive Planning Detection' (Trigger 1)"
- Phase 3: "Remove Step 5.5 'Automatic Collapse Detection' (lines 428-555)"

**Reality**: Grep search for "Step 1.55", "Step 3.4", "Step 5.5" returns only ONE mention:
- Line 284: "Relationship to reactive expansion (Step 3.4)" - **comment only, not a step header**

**Actual implement.md structure** (from reading file):
- No numbered "Step X.Y" headers found in traditional sense
- Workflow organized as markdown sections, not discrete numbered steps
- Line 274 (expected Step 1.55): Is "### 1.55. Proactive Expansion Check" section
- Line 322 (expected Step 3.4): Is "### 3.4. Adaptive Planning Detection" section
- Line 428 (expected Step 5.5): Is "### 5.5. Automatic Collapse Detection" section

**Revised Finding**: The steps DO exist as section headers (###), but plan's assumptions about their content may be outdated.

### 4. CLAUDE.md Configuration Contradictions

**Plan Phase 1 tasks**:
- "Remove 'Adaptive Planning Configuration' section with threshold values"
- "Remove all references to magic number thresholds (lines 217: 'score >8 or >10 tasks')"
- "Add new 'Careful Mode Configuration' section"

**Reality from CLAUDE.md (lines 245-283)**:
```markdown
## Adaptive Planning Configuration
[Used by: /plan, /expand, /implement, /revise]

### Complexity Thresholds

The following thresholds control when plans are automatically expanded or revised...

- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0 (phases with complexity score above this threshold...)
- **Task Count Threshold**: 10 (phases with more tasks than this threshold...)
- **File Reference Threshold**: 10 (phases referencing more files...)
- **Replan Limit**: 2 (maximum number of automatic replans...)
```

**Status**: Thresholds **still exist and are actively documented**. The section spans 38 lines (245-283).

**Grep for "careful_mode" returns**: **NO RESULTS**

**Conclusion**: Phase 1's objective to remove thresholds conflicts with the current documented configuration. Removing this section would break adaptive planning system.

### 5. Worktree Header in CLAUDE.md

**Plan did not account for**: Lines 1-27 of CLAUDE.md contain worktree metadata:
```markdown
# Worktree Task: optimize_claude

## Task Metadata
- **Type**: feature
- **Branch**: feature/optimize_claude
...
```

**Impact**: All line number references in Phase 1 are off by ~27 lines.

**Expected line 217** ("score >8 or >10 tasks"): Now at line 218 or 219 (shifted by worktree header)

## Phase-by-Phase Feasibility Analysis

### Phase 1: Configuration Updates and Foundation

**Status**: **BLOCKED - Contradictory Objectives**

**Issues**:
1. **Can't remove Adaptive Planning Configuration**: Section at lines 245-283 is integral to current system
   - Used by `/plan`, `/expand`, `/implement`, `/revise` (per section header)
   - Contains thresholds actively used: 8.0 expansion, 10 tasks, 2 replan limit
   - Removal would break documented adaptive planning behavior

2. **Worktree header shifts all line numbers**: All references off by 27 lines
   - Line 217 reference invalid
   - Lines 210-251 reference invalid
   - Must re-scan CLAUDE.md to find actual content locations

3. **Careful mode has no implementation**: No existing code references it
   - Would be adding NEW feature, not refactoring existing
   - No mention in implement.md or orchestrate.md workflows
   - Would require code changes to USE the configuration

**Recommendation**:
- **SKIP Phase 1** or redefine objectives
- Alternative: Add careful_mode WITHOUT removing thresholds (compatible coexistence)
- Must re-verify ALL line numbers after worktree header accounted for

### Phase 2: Post-Planning Complexity Review (Step 1.6)

**Status**: **FEASIBLE with Line Number Updates**

**Expanded Phase File**: phase_2_post_planning_complexity_review.md (988 lines)

**Issues**:
1. References "Step 1.6" insertion point at line 412 in implement.md
   - Must verify line 412 is still correct location
   - Actual file is 868 lines (matches plan expectation)

2. Depends on complexity_estimator agent (mentioned in plan)
   - Must verify agent exists and is functional
   - Must verify JSON response format matches plan assumptions

**Requirements for Adaptation**:
- [ ] Verify line 412 is correct insertion point for Step 1.6
- [ ] Check if Step 1.5 exists (immediately before)
- [ ] Verify Step 1.7 or Step 2 follows (for renumbering)
- [ ] Test complexity_estimator agent invocation
- [ ] Verify agent registry integration

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **Medium** (2-3 hours)
- Line number verification: 30 min
- Agent integration testing: 1 hour
- Update tasks in phase_2 expansion: 1 hour

### Phase 3: Remove Reactive Expansion/Collapse Logic

**Status**: **PARTIALLY FEASIBLE with Verification**

**Issues**:
1. Step references exist but content may differ:
   - Step 1.55 "Proactive Expansion Check" at line 274 (confirmed)
   - Step 3.4 "Adaptive Planning Detection" at line 322 (confirmed)
   - Step 5.5 "Automatic Collapse Detection" at line 428 (confirmed)

2. **CRITICAL**: Plan says "Remove Trigger 1 (complexity threshold)" from Step 3.4
   - Must verify Trigger 1 actually exists and is complexity-based
   - Plan says preserve Triggers 2 and 3 (test failures, scope drift)
   - Actual implementation uses adaptive planning logger with all triggers

3. **Complexity**: Step 5.5 is 128 lines (lines 428-555)
   - Contains auto-collapse logic using structure-eval-utils.sh
   - Logs collapse checks for observability
   - Integrated with `/revise --auto-mode collapse_phase`
   - Removing this would lose auto-collapse feature (may be desired?)

**Requirements for Adaptation**:
- [ ] Read actual content of Steps 1.55, 3.4, 5.5 to verify assumptions
- [ ] Verify Trigger 1 in Step 3.4 is removable without breaking Triggers 2/3
- [ ] Check if auto-collapse (Step 5.5) removal aligns with plan objectives
- [ ] Update step renumbering: Verify Steps 6 and 7 locations (plan says lines 556, 611)
- [ ] Check for references to removed steps elsewhere in implement.md

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **High** (4-6 hours)
- Content verification: 1 hour
- Trigger logic analysis: 2 hours
- Step removal and renumbering: 1-2 hours
- Testing and validation: 1 hour

### Phase 4: Automatic Debug Integration for Test Failures

**Status**: **FEASIBLE with Line Number Updates**

**Expanded Phase File**: phase_4_automatic_debug_integration.md (1320 lines)

**Issues**:
1. References Step 3.3 "Enhanced Error Analysis" at lines 591-651 (if tests fail)
   - Must verify lines 591-651 contain test failure handling
   - Plan expects to replace existing logic with /debug invocation

2. Requires SlashCommand tool integration with /debug
   - Must verify /debug command exists and is functional
   - Must verify output parsing for root cause extraction
   - Must verify Unicode box rendering for summary display

**Requirements for Adaptation**:
- [ ] Verify lines 591-651 contain test failure handling in implement.md
- [ ] Read actual Step 3.3 content to understand current logic
- [ ] Verify /debug command output format for parsing
- [ ] Test SlashCommand invocation pattern
- [ ] Update all line references in phase_4 expansion

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **Medium** (3-4 hours)
- Line number verification: 1 hour
- Debug command integration testing: 1 hour
- Update phase_4 expansion tasks: 1-2 hours

### Phase 5: Smart Checkpoint Auto-Resume for /implement

**Status**: **FEASIBLE with Minor Updates**

**Issues**:
1. References checkpoint section at lines 851-868 in implement.md
   - Plan says this matches current reality (18 lines)
   - Must verify section still at same location

2. Depends on checkpoint utilities (checkpoint-utils.sh)
   - Plan assumes utilities exist (they do per research findings)
   - Must verify checkpoint schema supports plan_modification_time field

**Requirements for Adaptation**:
- [ ] Verify lines 851-868 are still checkpoint section
- [ ] Check checkpoint schema in checkpoint-utils.sh
- [ ] Verify created_at, tests_passing, last_error fields exist
- [ ] Test checkpoint age calculation logic
- [ ] Update tasks if line numbers changed

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **Low** (1-2 hours)
- Verification: 30 min
- Schema checking: 30 min
- Task updates: 30 min-1 hour

### Phase 6: Smart Checkpoint Auto-Resume for /orchestrate

**Status**: **BLOCKED - Completely Invalid Line Numbers**

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Plan expects 1953 lines, actual is 5405 lines** (+178%)
   - Expected checkpoint section: lines 1884-1908
   - Actual checkpoint section: lines 5334-5391
   - **Shift of +3450 lines** - all references invalid

2. **Massive structural changes** from Phases 5-8 refactor:
   - New execution infrastructure added
   - Debugging loop integration
   - Implementation phase refactor
   - Checkpoint architecture may have changed significantly

3. **Plan references scattered throughout**:
   - Line 309-311: checkpoint data structure mention
   - Line 561, 671, 770, 773, 785, 801: various checkpoint references
   - Line 1019, 1035, 1077, 1094, 1422: more checkpoint references
   - Unknown if these line numbers still valid

**Requirements for Complete Rewrite**:
- [ ] Re-read entire orchestrate.md to understand current structure
- [ ] Find all checkpoint save/load locations (not just main section)
- [ ] Verify workflow_state structure matches plan assumptions
- [ ] Identify actual checkpoint metadata fields available
- [ ] Map out new line numbers for all checkpoint operations
- [ ] Rewrite ALL Phase 6 tasks with corrected line references

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **VERY HIGH** (8-12 hours)
- Full orchestrate.md analysis: 3-4 hours
- Checkpoint architecture mapping: 2-3 hours
- Phase 6 task rewriting: 3-4 hours
- Verification and testing: 1-2 hours

**Recommendation**: **Consider skipping orchestrate.md auto-resume** or creating entirely new plan focused only on orchestrate after implement is complete.

### Phase 7: Documentation and Testing

**Status**: **FEASIBLE with Updates**

**Issues**:
1. References total line counts:
   - implement.md: 868 lines (✓ MATCHES)
   - orchestrate.md: 1953 lines (✗ ACTUAL: 5405 lines)

2. References specific sections by line number:
   - implement.md line 17-56: "Adaptive Planning Features"
   - implement.md line 80: "Process" section
   - implement.md line 851-868: "Checkpoint Detection and Resume"
   - orchestrate.md line 20: "Checkpoint Management" overview
   - orchestrate.md line 1663: "Checkpoint Management Patterns" reference

3. **All orchestrate.md references invalid** due to size increase

**Requirements for Adaptation**:
- [ ] Verify all implement.md line references (likely still valid)
- [ ] Re-find all orchestrate.md sections (may have moved)
- [ ] Update test case descriptions to match current implementation
- [ ] Verify test scripts exist: test_adaptive_planning.sh, test_command_integration.sh
- [ ] Check if additional tests needed for new features in orchestrate.md

**Estimated Adaptation Effort**: **Medium** (3-5 hours)
- implement.md verification: 1 hour
- orchestrate.md re-mapping: 2-3 hours
- Test case updates: 1 hour

## Objective Feasibility Assessment

### Core Objectives from Plan 037

1. **Agent-Based Complexity Evaluation**: Replace magic-number thresholds with complexity_estimator agent
   - **Status**: ❌ **CONFLICTS WITH CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**
   - **Reason**: Adaptive Planning Configuration section (CLAUDE.md lines 245-283) is documented, functional, and used by 4 commands
   - **Recommendation**: Keep thresholds AND add agent-based evaluation (hybrid approach)

2. **Post-Planning Review**: Move expansion/contraction to single point after planning
   - **Status**: ✅ **FEASIBLE**
   - **Reason**: Step 1.6 insertion point seems valid, Phase 2 expansion is detailed
   - **Caveat**: Must verify line numbers and agent integration

3. **Automatic Debug Integration**: Test failures trigger /debug automatically
   - **Status**: ✅ **FEASIBLE**
   - **Reason**: /debug command exists, Phase 4 expansion is detailed
   - **Caveat**: Must verify Step 3.3 location and update line references

4. **Smart Auto-Resume**: Eliminate unnecessary checkpoint prompts
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FEASIBLE**
   - **Reason**: implement.md checkpoint section likely valid, orchestrate.md completely outdated
   - **Recommendation**: Implement for /implement first, defer /orchestrate

5. **Careful Mode Configuration**: Boolean flag to control recommendation display
   - **Status**: ❓ **UNCLEAR - NEW FEATURE**
   - **Reason**: No existing code references, would require implementation AND usage integration
   - **Recommendation**: Define scope and implementation approach before proceeding

## Recommendation: Complete Rewrite vs. Adaptation

### Adaptation Approach (Incremental)

**Pros**:
- Preserves Phase 2 and Phase 4 expansions (2308 lines of detailed spec)
- Can salvage Phase 1, 3, 5, 7 with line number updates
- Less upfront work to start implementation

**Cons**:
- Phase 6 (orchestrate) requires near-complete rewrite anyway
- Phase 1 objectives conflict with current system
- High risk of missing subtle changes throughout 868+ line files
- Incremental fixes may compound errors

**Estimated Total Adaptation Effort**: **25-35 hours**
- Phase 1: 4 hours (redesign objectives)
- Phase 2: 3 hours (verify and adapt)
- Phase 3: 6 hours (content verification and adaptation)
- Phase 4: 4 hours (verify and adapt)
- Phase 5: 2 hours (verify and adapt)
- Phase 6: 12 hours (major rewrite)
- Phase 7: 5 hours (documentation updates)

### Complete Rewrite Approach

**Pros**:
- Start from accurate current state
- Identify NEW opportunities from recent refactors
- Align objectives with actual system capabilities
- Cleaner, more coherent plan

**Cons**:
- Must re-analyze entire implementation
- Lose existing Phase 2 and 4 expansions (but can reference them)
- More upfront work before implementation

**Estimated Total Rewrite Effort**: **20-30 hours**
- Full codebase analysis: 8-10 hours
- Objective refinement: 2-3 hours
- Plan creation: 6-8 hours
- Expansion creation (if needed): 4-6 hours
- Testing strategy: 2-3 hours

**Recommended Approach**: **COMPLETE REWRITE**

### Why Rewrite is Superior

1. **Accuracy**: Start from actual current state, not outdated assumptions
2. **Efficiency**: 20-30 hours vs. 25-35 hours, with lower error risk
3. **Coherence**: Align objectives with capabilities discovered since original plan
4. **Learning**: Recent refactors may have ALREADY addressed some objectives
5. **Safety**: Avoid implementing changes that conflict with current system

## Specific Recommendations for Rewrite

### 1. Pre-Rewrite Investigation Tasks

**Read and Analyze** (use /report or manual analysis):
- [ ] Full read of implement.md (868 lines) to understand current workflow
- [ ] Full read of orchestrate.md (5405 lines) - focus on:
  - Checkpoint architecture (lines 5334-5391)
  - Execution infrastructure (likely early in file)
  - Debugging loop integration
  - Implementation phase refactor
- [ ] Scan complexity-utils.sh to understand current complexity scoring
- [ ] Scan adaptive-planning-logger.sh to understand trigger logging
- [ ] Review test files: test_adaptive_planning.sh, test_revise_automode.sh

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. Does adaptive planning ALREADY do some of what Plan 037 wants?
2. Has auto-collapse (Step 5.5) proven valuable or problematic?
3. Are magic number thresholds actually problematic, or just documented?
4. What NEW capabilities exist that weren't present on 2025-10-10?
5. Has careful_mode concept been discussed or partially implemented?

### 2. Objective Refinement

**Reassess Each Objective**:

**Agent-Based Complexity**:
- KEEP thresholds as fallback (they work)
- ADD agent-based override capability
- Careful mode could control: thresholds-only vs agent-first

**Post-Planning Review**:
- Verify this wasn't ALREADY added during Phase 2-8 refactors
- Check if proactive expansion (Step 1.55) already does this
- May only need enhancement, not new feature

**Automatic Debug Integration**:
- Likely still valuable
- Check if any auto-debug patterns already exist in error handling

**Smart Auto-Resume**:
- Focus on implement.md first
- Defer orchestrate.md until checkpoint architecture fully understood
- May want to wait for orchestrate to stabilize

**Careful Mode**:
- Define EXACTLY what it controls
- Specify where in code it would be checked
- Consider: Is this better as a command-line flag than CLAUDE.md config?

### 3. Plan Structure Recommendations

**Single Plan vs. Multi-Plan**:
- Consider splitting into TWO plans:
  1. Plan 037A: implement.md improvements (Phases 1-3, 5)
  2. Plan 037B: orchestrate.md improvements (Phase 6)

**Progressive Expansion**:
- Start as Level 0 (single file)
- Use /expand as needed during implementation
- Phase 2 and 4 expansions can be REFERENCED but rewritten

**Research-Driven**:
- Create NEW research report: "Current State of Interruption Points in /implement and /orchestrate"
- Use /report to analyze actual current behavior
- Base new plan on empirical findings, not assumptions

## Alternative: Incremental Verification and Adaptation

If complete rewrite is not desired, follow this **minimum viable adaptation path**:

### Step 1: Line Number Verification Script

Create verification script to check ALL line references:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify_plan_037_lines.sh

echo "=== Plan 037 Line Number Verification ==="

echo -e "\n## CLAUDE.md (expected ~300, actual $(wc -l < CLAUDE.md))"
echo "Checking key sections..."
grep -n "Adaptive Planning Configuration" CLAUDE.md || echo "  [ERROR] Section not found"
grep -n "score >8" CLAUDE.md || echo "  [INFO] Threshold reference not found"
grep -n "careful_mode" CLAUDE.md || echo "  [INFO] Careful mode not found"

echo -e "\n## implement.md (expected 868, actual $(wc -l < .claude/commands/implement.md))"
echo "Checking Steps mentioned in plan..."
grep -n "^### 1.55" .claude/commands/implement.md || echo "  [ERROR] Step 1.55 not found"
grep -n "^### 3.3" .claude/commands/implement.md || echo "  [ERROR] Step 3.3 not found"
grep -n "^### 3.4" .claude/commands/implement.md || echo "  [ERROR] Step 3.4 not found"
grep -n "^### 5.5" .claude/commands/implement.md || echo "  [ERROR] Step 5.5 not found"
grep -n "Checkpoint Detection and Resume" .claude/commands/implement.md

echo -e "\n## orchestrate.md (expected 1953, actual $(wc -l < .claude/commands/orchestrate.md))"
echo "Checking checkpoint section..."
grep -n "## Checkpoint Detection and Resume" .claude/commands/orchestrate.md

echo -e "\n=== Summary ==="
echo "If any [ERROR] lines above, plan references are invalid"
echo "Line number discrepancies require plan task updates"
```

Run this script and UPDATE every task in Plan 037 with correct line numbers.

### Step 2: Phase-by-Phase Validation

For EACH phase:
1. Run verification script
2. Read ACTUAL content at referenced lines
3. Compare with plan assumptions
4. Update plan tasks with corrections
5. Mark phase as "VALIDATED" or "NEEDS REWRITE"

**Priority order**:
1. Phase 5 (implement checkpoint - lowest risk)
2. Phase 2 (post-planning review - high value)
3. Phase 4 (auto-debug - high value)
4. Phase 3 (remove steps - medium risk)
5. Phase 1 (config changes - conflicts to resolve)
6. Phase 7 (documentation - depends on others)
7. Phase 6 (orchestrate - defer or rewrite)

### Step 3: Conflict Resolution

**Phase 1 Conflicts**:
- **Option A**: Keep thresholds, add careful_mode alongside (coexistence)
- **Option B**: Skip Phase 1 entirely, accept threshold-based approach
- **Option C**: Redefine Phase 1 to enhance, not replace, thresholds

**Phase 6 Conflicts**:
- **Option A**: Defer Phase 6 indefinitely, focus on implement.md
- **Option B**: Create new mini-plan for orchestrate after implement complete
- **Option C**: Invest 12 hours to rewrite Phase 6 based on 5405-line reality

## Testing and Validation Strategy

### Before Implementing ANY Phase

**Required Validations**:
1. **Line Number Match**: Run verification script, update tasks
2. **Content Read**: Read actual section content, verify it matches assumptions
3. **Dependency Check**: Verify all utilities, agents, commands exist
4. **Test Coverage**: Identify existing tests that would break

### After Implementing Each Phase

**Required Tests**:
1. **Run existing test suite**: All tests must still pass
2. **Test new functionality**: New features work as designed
3. **Regression check**: Old workflows still work
4. **Documentation review**: All docs updated to reflect changes

### Integration Testing

**Cross-Phase Tests**:
- Post-planning review (Phase 2) + auto-debug (Phase 4) + auto-resume (Phase 5)
- Verify phases work together harmoniously
- Check for unexpected interactions

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

1. **orchestrate.md is 178% larger than expected**: 5405 vs 1953 lines
2. **Phase 6 is completely invalid**: All line numbers off by 3000+
3. **CLAUDE.md thresholds still present**: Removal would break documented system
4. **implement.md mostly intact**: 868 lines matches, but content verification needed
5. **Phase 2 and 4 expansions preserved**: 2308 lines of detailed spec still valuable

### Recommended Action Plan

**Immediate Actions** (if continuing with Plan 037):
1. Create and run line number verification script
2. Decide: Rewrite vs. Incremental Adaptation
3. Resolve Phase 1 conflicts (thresholds vs. agent-based)
4. Defer or separate Phase 6 (orchestrate.md)

**Long-Term Actions**:
1. Create research report on current interruption points
2. Analyze what recent refactors accomplished
3. Generate new plan based on current reality
4. Consider splitting into multiple focused plans

### Final Recommendation

**COMPLETE REWRITE** of Plan 037 using current codebase as foundation:
- Start with /report to analyze actual current state
- Use /plan to generate new implementation plan
- Reference Phase 2 and 4 expansions but rewrite based on findings
- Split into separate plans for implement.md and orchestrate.md
- Estimate: 20-30 hours for rewrite vs. 25-35 hours for adaptation
- Lower risk, higher accuracy, better alignment with project state

**Alternative Path** (if rewrite not feasible):
- Implement Phase 5 first (lowest risk, highest value)
- Implement Phase 2 second (after verification)
- Implement Phase 4 third (after verification)
- Skip or defer Phases 1, 3, 6
- Total: ~10-15 hours for partial implementation

### Success Metrics

**If adapting**: Each phase validated before implementation, <5% task changes after validation

**If rewriting**: New plan references <10 invalid line numbers, all objectives align with current capabilities
