# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation preserved for reference purposes.

## Purpose

These documents represent previous implementations, migration guides, or architectural approaches that have been superseded by current documentation. They are retained for:

- Historical context
- Understanding past design decisions
- Reference during troubleshooting
- Audit trail of system evolution

## Important Notice

**These documents are historical references. See main docs for current implementation.**

For current, up-to-date documentation, refer to the main documentation directory at [.claude/docs/README.md](../README.md).

### Migration Guides

- **migration-guide-adaptive-plans.md** - Migration guide for adaptive planning tier system (superseded by integrated documentation)
- **specs_migration_guide.md** - Specs directory migration guide (topic-based structure now standard)

### Historical Architecture

- **orchestration_enhancement_guide.md** - Early orchestration enhancements (integrated into orchestration-guide.md)
- **architecture.md** - Phase 7 modularization architecture (integrated into current command documentation)

## When to Use Archive

Use archived documents when:
- Investigating historical implementation details
- Understanding why certain design decisions were made
- Troubleshooting issues related to legacy systems
- Researching system evolution for documentation purposes
