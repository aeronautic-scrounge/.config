# Test Plan: Microservices Architecture Migration

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Plan Number**: 003
- **Feature**: Migrate monolith to microservices
- **Estimated Phases**: 5

## Overview

Refactor monolithic application into microservices architecture with event-driven communication.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Design

**Objective**: Design microservices architecture and service boundaries

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze current monolith dependencies
- [ ] Identify service boundaries using domain-driven design
- [ ] Design inter-service communication patterns
- [ ] Define API contracts and schemas
- [ ] Design event bus architecture
- [ ] Create migration strategy document
- [ ] Review with architecture team
- [ ] Design database per service strategy
- [ ] Plan for distributed transactions
- [ ] Design service discovery mechanism
- [ ] Plan for distributed logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create rollback strategy

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup

**Objective**: Set up Kubernetes cluster and service mesh

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Install Istio service mesh
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Configure distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- [ ] Set up centralized logging (ELK stack)
- [ ] Configure service discovery
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for each service
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Set up secrets management
- [ ] Configure network policies

### Phase 3: Extract Authentication Service

**Objective**: Extract and deploy first microservice

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extract authentication module code
- [ ] Refactor to remove monolith dependencies
- [ ] Create service repository
- [ ] Design authentication API
- [ ] Implement JWT token management
- [ ] Add OAuth2 provider integration
- [ ] Implement session migration strategy
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Deploy to production with feature flag
- [ ] Monitor and validate

### Phase 4: Data Migration and Synchronization

**Objective**: Migrate data from monolith to services

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design dual-write strategy for data sync
- [ ] Implement event sourcing for critical entities
- [ ] Create data migration scripts
- [ ] Test data consistency
- [ ] Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
- [ ] Add compensating transactions
- [ ] Test failure scenarios
- [ ] Create data reconciliation jobs
- [ ] Monitor data consistency metrics
- [ ] Plan for eventual consistency

### Phase 5: Complete Migration and Decomission

**Objective**: Extract remaining services and decomission monolith

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extract user service
- [ ] Extract order service
- [ ] Extract payment service
- [ ] Extract notification service
- [ ] Update all inter-service communication
- [ ] Migrate remaining data
- [ ] Update DNS and routing
- [ ] Verify all functionality
- [ ] Performance testing at scale
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests
- [ ] Decomission monolith
- [ ] Update documentation
